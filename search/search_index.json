A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial.

Creatures that do not rely on sight, can see in magical darkness, or are native to the Plane of Shadow are immune to this effect of the wall.</p> <p>DANCING SHROUD (WRITHING GLOOM)</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a short length of black rope or cord)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You summon wisps and tendrils of semisolid shadow in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within range. The shadows are difficult terrain and can impede up to six creatures of your choice that you can see. When the spell is cast and when a chosen creature starts its turn in the area, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p> <p>On a failed save, the creature is restrained. If a creature restrained in this way attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the spell fails, and the spell slot or usage is lost. It can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.</p> <p>DOUSE</p> <p>Transmutation cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous, or up to 1 hour</p> <p>You infuse the light before you with shade. All nonmagical light sources the size of a campfire or smaller in a 60-foot cube originating from you are affected. Choose one of the following options: Affected light sources now shed dim light out to the range they normally shed bright light for 1 hour. Creatures have resistance to any fire damage shed by affected light sources. You can extinguish one light source in the area, causing it to shed no light. If the light source was fire, the fire goes out. If the sources were some other form of nonmagical light such as luminous fungi, they are extinguished for 1 hour. As a bonus action, you can end the effects of the spell (extinguished flames don\u2019t reignite). Small or larger creatures who produce nonmagical light are immune to this spell.</p> <p>DUSK AND DAWN (SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self (30-foot radius)</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 1 hour</p> <p>You can raise or lower the ambient light within range by one \u201cstep\u201d\u2014changing bright light or darkness to dim light, or changing dim light to bright light or darkness. At any time during the duration, you can spend an action to change the level again (though you can never change it to two \u201csteps\u201d beyond its ambient level).</p> <p>Darkvision and magical light function normally in dim light and darkness created by this spell. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the radius of the effect increases by 15 feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p> <p>ECLIPSE ARCANE (THE WEAVE UNMADE) 9<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self (60-foot radius)</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>All ongoing spells of 7<sup>th</sup> level or lower within the radius are automatically dispelled, as per dispel magic. For each spell of 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> level in the area, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u2019s level. On a successful check, the spell ends. When casting eclipse arcane, you can choose to exclude any spell effects currently affecting you or objects in your possession.</p> <p>ELDRITCH TWILIGHT (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p> <p>Shadowy tendrils intertwined with threads of magic expand in a 20-foot sphere from a point you can see within range. The area becomes dim light for the duration. The mystic shadows interfere with spellcasting. A creature within the area that attempts to cast a spell, or a creature outside the area that casts a spell targeting anything in the area, must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. Targets proficient in the Arcana skill can add their proficiency bonus to the roll, even if their spellcasting ability is not Intelligence. On a failure, the spell fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted. Shadowcasters who are outside the spell\u2019s area can cast their spells into the area normally.</p> <p>EPHEMERAL IMAGE</p> <p>(DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 1,000 miles</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours</p> <p>You create a duplicate of yourself, made up semisolid shadow, anywhere within range that you can see or have seen before. This functions identically to the spell project image, with the following alterations: - Because the illusion is semisolid, mild physical interaction with it does not reveal it to be an illusion. A successful attack, or a creature that uses its action to physically examine the image and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC reveals the image\u2019s true nature. - The image can manipulate small objects, as per the mage hand spell. - You can cast spells of 5<sup>th</sup> level or lower through the image, as though you occupied its space. - The illusion can fly at its normal speed (twice your walking speed). If you restrict its movement in a given round to half that speed, you can cause it to move as a bonus action rather than a normal action. - If the illusion takes damage, you can make a Constitution saving throw as if you took the damage dealt to the image. If you succeed, the illusion doesn\u2019t disappear.</p> <p>EPHEMERAL STORM</p> <p>(THE SHADOW BLEEDS)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 200 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>A tumult of slicing shadows and white lightning crash down from the heavens in a 15-foot radius around a point you can see within range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 lightning damage and 5d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p>When you cast the spell, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to be unaffected by it.</p> <p>FAR SIGHT (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup>-level divination</p> <p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a mirror or reflective ball made of polished obsidian, worth at least 1,500 gp)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>This spell functions as scrying, but you also gain the benefits ofcomprehend languages, detect magic, and true seeing through the sensor.</p> <p>FLAME BLADE (FORGED OF NIGHT)</p> <p>When you cast flame blade as a shadowcaster spell, the blade created is a twisting saber life-draining gloom. The spell deals necrotic damage.</p> <p>FLICKERING MOTES</p> <p>Evocation cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Up to 8 hours</p> <p>Choose one creature within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is beset with tiny shadows at the corner of its vision. The target has disadvantage on the next Intelligence or Wisdom check it makes, or on its passive Perception against the next Dexterity (Stealth) check made to hide from it. The spell then ends.</p> <p>The spell ends if you cast it again.</p> <p>HELLISH REBUKE</p> <p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p> <p>When you cast hellish rebuke as a shadowcaster spell, the spell causes the target to writhe in frigid shadows. The spell deals your choice of cold or necrotic damage.</p> <p>HYPNOTIC SHADE (WRITHING GLOOM)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 90 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror, polished coin, or other means of creating a flickering light)</p> <p>Duration: 1 minute</p> <p>A writhing, shifting pattern of shadow appears at a point you can see within range. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 30 feet of the chosen point, and who can see it, are affected in ascending order of their current hit points. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is charmed until the spell ends. A creature charmed in this way is paralyzed. The charmed condition ends if the creature takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature out of its stupor. Subtract each creature\u2019s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p> <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot above first.</p> <p>IMPRISONMENT (WORLDS APART)</p> <p>When you cast imprisonment as a shadowcaster spell, you</p> <p>must select either the \u201cburial\u201d or \u201chedged prison\u201d options.</p> <p>INFINITE MIRROR (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level divination</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror or prism)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to ten minutes</p> <p>You instantly become aware of and can see any magical sensors (such as arcane eye, or those created by clairvoyance or scrying) currently observing you, or that begin to observe you during the duration. As an action, you can focus on a sensor and force that spell\u2019s caster to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose one of the following options:</p> <p>The spell used to create the sensor ends.</p> <p>You create a sensor and observe the caster as if you successfully cast the scrying spell on them. If the caster ceases concentration on their spell, you can choose to maintain it as long as you concentrate on infinite mirror, allowing both of you to continue observing through your sensors as normal. You can use this option on only one spell at a time, and you can end your observation on an existing spell at any time.</p> <p>A creature that succeeds on its saving throw can\u2019t be affected by this casting ofinfinite mirror.</p> <p>INVESTITURE OF SHADOW</p> <p>(HANDS OF DUSK)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>Darkness suffuses your body for the duration, granting you the following benefits. - You have resistance to cold and necrotic damage. - Your walking speed increases by 20, you gain a climb speed equal to your new walking speed, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1-inch wide. - You can use your action to create a wave of darkness that fills the area within 15 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 cold and 2d8 necrotic damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not blinded on a successful one.</p> <p>LIFE FADES (TOUCH OF TWILIGHT)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level necromancy</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 15 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature that isn\u2019t a construct or undead within range. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from this spell can\u2019t exceed two levels. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above first.</p> <p>LIQUID NIGHT</p> <p>Conjuration cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Touch</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a vial, bottle, bowl, or other container to hold the ink)</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>You cause the shadows to coalesce into a small quantity of ink in an empty container you are holding. This creates enough ink to write a page\u2019s worth of text. It is not of sufficient quality to be used for scribing spells. When you cast the spell, you can decide if the ink behaves normally, or if it glows a faint red in dim light or darkness. In the latter case, the ink and anything written or drawn with it sheds dim light out to 5 feet.</p> <p>If you cast this spell again before the ink is used to write, paint, stain, or dye something, the previous casting\u2019s worth of ink disappears.</p> <p>NIGHTFIRE (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p> <p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (ash from a fire that was doused rather than burning itself out)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>An eerie black and gray flame erupts from the ground in a 5-foot sphere centered on a point you can see. The flame sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p> <p>When a creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on its turn, or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 1d10 cold damage and 1d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much of each on a successful one. In addition, the creature is limned in ghostly flame until the start of its next tur while so illuminated, the creature cannot benefit from invisibility and has disadvantage on Stealth checks. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the flame up to 60 feet in any direction.</p> <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, either the cold or necrotic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot above second.</p> <p>OBSCURING SHADOWS</p> <p>(TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p> <p>4<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 20 feet</p> <p>Components: V</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You wrap twisting shadows around up to six creatures within range that you can see. All attack rolls against a target obscured by this spell have disadvantage. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn\u2019t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p> <p>PASS INTO SHADOW (EBON ROADS)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Touch</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (an uncut jet or onyx worth at least 200 gp)</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to the Plane of Shadow. Other than allowing passage to only that single plane, pass into shadow otherwise functions as the spell plane shift.</p> <p>POWER WORD FEAR (DREAD SOUL)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level enchantment</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>You speak a dread word of power that causes inescapable, soul-deep panic to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to overwhelming terror. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being frightened.</p> <p>While the target is affected by this numbing terror, the target must move before taking any other action each turn, and it must move as far from you as possible. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws other than Wisdom saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted.</p> <p>A target suffering this fear can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p> <p>PRISON OF NIGHT (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 100 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a rod of polished jet or onyx worth at least 400 gp)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p> <p>You create a 10-foot cube of opaque shadow centered on a point you can see. The cube blocks line of sight. When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage\u2019s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the cube and must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p>As an action, a creature can attempt to push through the shadowy walls by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. A creature that touches the cube takes 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage.</p> <p>SCREEN (DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 24 hours</p> <p>You create an entire illusory scene, complete with sights, sounds, scents, and even feel, which can be as large as a 100-foot cube within range. Within that area, you can make terrain and structures appear however you like. You can create illusory creatures, who behave as you describe, and you can decide whether real creatures, objects, or structures are visible or invisible on an individual basis. You set the descriptions and behavior of illusory creatures, and cloak existing creatures when you cast the spell and can\u2019t change these decisions later. A creature made invisible by this spell that makes an attack, damages a creature, or forces a creature to make a saving throw becomes visible. Each round on your turn, harmful images created by the spell can deal 1d8 psychic damage to up to six creatures interacting with them according to the parameters you set. The creatures believe the damage takes the form of whatever is appropriate; a wolf\u2019s ripping jaws, burns from lava, crushing boulders tumbling down a cliff, etc.</p> <p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the area\u2019s true form; but all other aspects of the illusion remain, so creatures can still physically interact with the illusion, which appears hazy and translucent to them. Creatures, objects, or pieces of terrain created by the illusion vanish if they leave the area.</p> <p>SHADOW FORM (CLOAK OF SHADE)</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a bit of smooth obsidian or dark glass)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p> <p>You become a living shadow, appearing as a dark, wavering silhouette of yourself. Equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form. You can\u2019t use or benefit from any equipment while a shadow. While in this form, your walking speed is reduced by 10, but you gain a climb speed equal to your reduced walking speed. While in dim light or darkness you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks; and gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, as well as on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You gain vulnerability to radiant damage, and when in bright light, attacks against you gain advantage. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If you fall, you do so slowly. You fall 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</p> <p>While in this form, you can\u2019t make weapon attacks, cast spells, or manipulate objects or creatures. You can speak, but only in a rough whisper.</p> <p>For the duration, you can make a special draining attack as an action. Make a melee spell attack with a reach of 15 feet. If you hit, the target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 necrotic damage.</p> <p>SHADOW OUT OF TIME</p> <p>(SHADOW\u2019S EMBRACE)</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 3 rounds</p> <p>You transport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying to an isolated pocket of the Plane of Shadow where time moves faster. This pocket is a cylindrical space 20 feet wide and 20 feet high. It is blank and featureless, save for a small planar window that shows the area you just left. The window allows observation only; you can\u2019t interact in any way through the window, and the window is invisible from the other side. During each turn you take in the pocket, you can take three turns worth of actions. Creatures observed through the window appear to move in slow motion.</p> <p>While in the shadow pocket, you can only affect yourself and objects you brought with you. You can end the spell early as an action. When the spell ends, you reappear on the Material Plane in an unoccupied space anywhere within 1,000 feet of the spot where you cast the spell.</p> <p>SHADOW PUPPETS (HANDS OF DUSK)</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You summon a broad swathe of coiling, grasping shadows. Choose a point you can see within range; the shadows occupy a 30-foot-radius sphere from that point. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain for your enemies. At the start of each of your turns, each enemy within 10 feet of a light source within the radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d12 cold damage if the light source is a fire or otherwise radiates heat, or 2d12 necrotic damage if the light source is magical or otherwise radiates no heat.</p> <p>At the start of your turn, choose one creature within the area. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled by the shadows. The creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can command the shadows to lash out against one creature within the area. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 cold damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p>SHROUD OF NIGHTMARE</p> <p>(CLOAK OF SHADE)</p> <p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Touch</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 10 minutes</p> <p>You touch a willing creature, surrounding it with a flickering aura of shade. For the duration, when the target makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. A creature that forces the target to make one of those saving throws immediately takes 2d8 psychic damage.</p> <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2<sup>nd</sup>, to a maximum of 4d8.</p> <p>SPELL ECHO (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet, and see text</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Special; see text</p> <p>Choose any spell of 4<sup>th</sup>-level or lower, with a casting time of 1 action or less, that was cast by another creature within range since the end of your last turn. You must have been able to see the caster and any effect of the spell itself. You immediately duplicate that spell, targeting it as you choose, and using your own abilities, and spell save DC. It follows all the normal rules of range, targeting, school, duration, concentration, and so forth, though you are not required to provide any material components.</p> <p>At Higher Level. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you can duplicate a spell of one level higher than fourth for each slot level above 6<sup>th</sup>.</p> <p>SPELL TURNING (THE WEAVE UNMADE)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p> <p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p> <p>A murky aura surrounds you, reflecting certain spells back at the caster. Only spells that specifically target you are affected; spells that affect an area which happens to include you are not.</p> <p>Roll 1d4+6 when you cast this spell; this is the total number of spell levels the aura can reflect. When you are targeted by a spell, it instead affects the caster as though they were the target, and you subtract the spell\u2019s level from the number of levels remaining. When you run out of levels remaining, the spell ends.</p> <p>If you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the levels remaining to your spell turning, you may suffer only a partial effect, or reflect only a partial effect. If the levels remaining to your spell turning equal half or less than half of the spell\u2019s level, you suffer a partial effect; if the levels remaining are greater than half the spell\u2019s level, the caster suffers a partial effect.</p> <p>When someone suffers a spell\u2019s partial effect, they have advantage on any applicable saves, take only half of any damage, and the spell\u2019s maximum duration is halved. If both you and the caster are under the effect of spell turning, you both subtract half the spell\u2019s level from your remaining total and are both subject to a partial effect as described above.</p> <p>SPIRIT GUARDIANS</p> <p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p> <p>When you cast spirit guardians, as a shadowcaster spell, the spirits appear as featureless, shadowy silhouettes, and deal necrotic damage, regardless of your alignment.</p> <p>Storm of Vengeance (The Shadow Bleeds)</p> <p>When you cast storm of vengeance as a shadowcaster spell, the rain in round two is shadow hail, dealing your choice of cold or necrotic damage rather than acid damage as per normal.</p> <p>TWILIGHT TENDRIL</p> <p>Evocation cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 20 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>A tendril of shadow lashes out at one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved 10 feet in any direction you choose, and then take 1d6 points of cold damage.</p> <p>This spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level (2d6), 11<sup>th</sup> level (3d6), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (4d6).</p> <p>UMBRAL DOPPELGANGER</p> <p>(BORN OF NIGHT)</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You send one creature that you can see within range to a pocket of the Plane of Shadow, while simultaneously summoning a shadowy duplicate of that creature to act on your behalf. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the target is not banished, and the duplicate appears in the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target and disappears at the end of its own turn. On a failed save, the target disappears, reappearing in the Plane of Shadow, while the duplicate appears in the space the target vacated. While in the Plane of Shadow, the target is incapacitated.</p> <p>When it first appears, the duplicate is statistically identical to the target except for the following distinctions: The duplicate has resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage. - All damage caused by the duplicate is either cold or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the spell), rather than the standard type caused by its weapons, spells, or other features. - The duplicate can only cast spells/duplicate spell effects up to 6<sup>th</sup> level, whether on its own or via magic items, even if the original creature can cast or create higher-level magics. - Any of the duplicate\u2019s equipment that is removed or dropped disappears at the start of the duplicate\u2019s next turn, unless the duplicate takes possession of it before then. The duplicate acts on the target creature\u2019s initiative, losing all ties, and is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to the duplicate, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p> <p>The banished creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, or when the spell ends, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target returns before the spell ends, the duplicate disappears at the end of its next turn and the spell ends. The target and the duplicate have advantage on attack rolls against one another.</p> <p>UMBRAL FORM (SHADOW\u2019S EMBRACE)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 8 hours</p> <p>You step into the dimensional overlap between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow. With the exception of involving the Plane of Shadow instead of the Ethereal Plane, this otherwise functions in all respect as the spell etherealness.</p> <p>UMBRAL HORDE (BORN OF NIGHT)</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 1 round/2 rounds; see text</p> <p>Choose up to five creatures within range; each target must attempt a Constitution save. On a failure, a target is banished to the Plane of Shadow and replaced by a dark duplicate, as per umbral doppelganger. On a success, the target is not banished, but the duplicate still appears adjacent to them.</p> <p>The duplicates act as a group, immediately after you in the initiative order. If a target succeeded on its saving throw, that target\u2019s duplicate vanishes at the end of its turn Targets sent to the Plane of Shadow are incapacitated and return at the end of your next turn. Their duplicates then disappear at the end of their own next turn. The duplicates function in all ways as described in umbral doppelganger.</p> <p>UMBRAL TOOL (FORGED OF NIGHT)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>You summon a tool made of shadow into your free hand. This can be any mundane, simple tool: a hammer, a crowbar, a chisel, a saw, and so forth. It functions exactly like the real thing in all respects, and you can even pass it off to a companion for their own use.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can create a simple, one-handed weapon instead of a tool. It doesn\u2019t count as magical for overcoming resistance or immunity to damage.</p> <p>The items created by this spell are somewhat rough and lacking in detail, so if you use it to duplicate tools that require precision\u2014such as thieves\u2019 tools or calligrapher\u2019s tools\u2014you have disadvantage on checks made while using them.</p> <p>VAMPIRIC WALL (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup>-level necromancy</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 90 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a few bloodstained black or gray threads)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall is opaque, but creatures and objects can pass through it. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Choose one creature that took damage from the wall. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage taken by that creature. When a creature enters the wall\u2019s area for the first time on a turn, or ends its turn there, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</p> <p>Each time the wall deals necrotic damage due to a creature entering its area or ending a turn there, the length of the wall is reduced by 5 feet. If the length reaches 0, the spell ends.</p> <p>VENGEFUL SHADE</p> <p>Necromancy cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 30 feet</p> <p>Components: V, M (a weapon)</p> <p>Duration: 1 round</p> <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell\u2019s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack\u2019s normal effects, and is surrounded by dancing, writhing ribbons of shadow until the start of your next turn. If, before that time, the creature targets you with an attack or spell, or ends its movement closer to you than when it started, it immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage and the spell ends.</p> <p>This spell\u2019s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5<sup>th</sup> level, the weapon attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for targeting or closing on you increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11<sup>th</sup> level and 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p> <p>WINDOWS OF SHADE</p> <p>(SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a pinch of coal dust)</p> <p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p> <p>You gain the ability to see normally in darkness, even magical darkness, out to 60 feet.</p> <p>At any point during the duration, you can spend a bonus action to end the spell and make a gaze attack against any living creature you can see, and that can see you, within 60 feet. The target takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. The creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns; if it can\u2019t see you, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the effect ends</p>"},{"location":"Classes/Shadowcaster/Shadowcaster%20Spell%20List/","title":"Shadowcaster Spell List","text":"<p>As previously described, shadowcaster spells are divided into thematic Paths, as well as by level.

The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your shadowcaster spells of 1<sup>st</sup> level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>For example, when you are 5<sup>th</sup> level, you have two 3<sup>rd</sup>- level spell slots. To cast the 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell dusk and dawn, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level spell.</p> <p>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</p> <p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spells of your choice from the shadowcaster spell list.</p> <p>The Spells Known column of the Shadowcaster table shows when you learn more shadowcaster spells of your choice of 1<sup>st</sup> level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what\u2019s shown in the table\u2019s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6<sup>th</sup> level, for example, you learn a new shadowcaster spell, which can be 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> level.</p> <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shadowcaster spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shadowcaster spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. (Remember, however, that many Mysteries require you to have completed Paths, or to have access to a certain number of Paths, as part of their prerequisite. If you no longer meet these prerequisites due to replacing a spell, you lose access to that Mystery\u2019s benefits.)</p> <p>SPELL PATHS</p> <p>In addition to being divided by level, as with other classes, shadowcaster spells are also divided into related groups of three called Paths. Initiate-level Paths include spells of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> level; Intermediate-level Paths of 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup> level; and Master-level Paths of 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, and 9<sup>th</sup> level. (You learn spells of 6<sup>th</sup> level and above by taking certain Mysteries, not through your standard shadow magic class feature. Mysteries are magical or supernatural abilities you possess, as described below.) In most ways, these Paths are purely thematic, like spell schools. You are not required to complete a Path once begun, nor are you required to choose spells from a Path in order. When you learn a 5<sup>th</sup>-level spell, for instance, it need not come from the same Path as any 4<sup>th</sup>-level spells you know.</p> <p>Certain Mysteries, however, do require that you have completed a Path in order to take them, while others require that you have access to spells from multiple different Paths. Thus, depending on which Mysteries you wish to take, it may be more advantageous to focus your spells and complete a few Paths; or go for a broad selection of abilities instead. Each has its advantages.</p> <p>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</p> <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your shadowcaster spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shadowcaster spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p> <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p> <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p> <p>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</p> <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your shadowcaster spells.</p> <p>eyes of nighteyes of night</p> <p>At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain darkvision 60 feet (or an additional 60 feet, if you already have darkvision), and you suffer no disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks when the area you are in, or into which you are looking, is obscured by dim light.</p> <p>Mysteries Of Shadow</p> <p>As you delve deeper into your investigations of night, of the void, of the Plane of Shadow, you learn scraps and snippets of larger, incomprehensible eldritch truths. These secrets, known as Mysteries of Shadow, grant you additional mystical abilities, powers, or simple understanding. At their highest levels, some even grant you the ability to cast spells of higher level than your shadow magic spell slots would normally permit. At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain two Mysteries of Shadow of your choice. Your mystery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain shadowcaster levels, you gain additional mysteries of your choice, as shown in the Mysteries Known column of the Shadowcaster table.</p> <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mysteries you know and replace it with another mystery that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p> <p>Gloaming Feast</p> <p>When you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level, your bond to the Plane of Shadow allows you to absorb tenebrous energies that fulfil or mitigate certain biological needs. You no longer require food or drink. Additionally, you only need four hours of sleep (or trance for only two, if you\u2019re an elf), which is sufficient for you to finish a long rest. At 8<sup>th</sup> level, your needs lessen even further, to a single hour of sleep (or half an hour of trance) per night. At 13<sup>th</sup> level, you become immune to nonmagical disease and poison. Finally, at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you no longer need to breathe, and never require sleep or trance. Magic can\u2019t put you to sleep.</p> <p>Ability Score Improvement</p> <p>When you reach 4<sup>th</sup> level, and again at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 19<sup>th</sup> level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p> <p>Shade-Touched Soul</p> <p>At 7<sup>th</sup> level, the darkness with which you so regularly interact has wound itself into your sense\u2014and strength\u2014 of self. You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws, if you do not already have it.</p> <p>Never-Ending Night</p> <p>At 20<sup>th</sup> level, when you roll for initiative and have no spell slots remaining, you regain 1 Shadow Magic spell slot.</p> <p>Penumbral Ways</p> <p>All shadowcasters are a bit odd, even compared to other spellcasters. The effort to understand the metaphysical meaning and powers of darkness, of the Plane of Shadow\u2019s influence on the real world, is stressful to even the strongest minds, requiring mastery of formulae and arcane theories that fly in the face of sanity. Thus, in order to avoid shattering their minds, all shadowcasters approach their art through one specific aspect of darkness, one particular area where\u2014be it factually or thematically\u2014the Plane of Shadow overlaps reality. This combination of approach and framework of study is called a Penumbral Way. Three of the most common focus on fear as a representation of inner darkness; on the intertwining of shadow\u2019s influence on magic itself; and on the literal connection between planes, where the Plane of Shadow actually affects the environment of the Material Plane.</p> <p>Dread Witch</p> <p>The so-called Dread Witch approaches shadow magic through the lens of the sentient mind. The darkness within\u2014fear, primarily, but also despair and other \u201cnegative\u201d emotions as well\u2014form a conduit to the darkness beyond that of the rational world. By learning to manipulate terror, both their own and others\u2019, the Dread Witch learns to tap into greater and more tangible magics as well.</p> <p>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</p> <p>Due to their focus on fear and related \u201cdark\u201d emotions, Dread Witches can select from an expanded list of spells when learning shadowcaster spells. The following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell list for you.</p> <p>DREAD HEART</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup> level command</p> <p>2<sup>nd</sup> level phantasmal force</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup> level fear</p> <p>DREAD NIGHTMARES</p> <p>4<sup>th</sup> level phantasmal killer</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup> level dream</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup> level magic jar</p> <p>DREAD SOUL</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup> level power word fear*</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup> level antipathy/sympathy</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup> level weird</p> <p>*- indicates a new spell presented in this book</p> <p>DREAD PRESENCE</p> <p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. In addition, as an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. Creatures that fail their saving throws are frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>FEAR-WIELDER</p> <p>At 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead of your normal proficiency bonus. In addition, when you are subject to an effect meant to cause you to become frightened\u2014even if you successfully save or are immune to fear\u2014you can choose to gain a special form of inspiration that you must spend before the end of your next turn. You can gain this even if you already have inspiration. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>DREAD MASTER</p> <p>Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain resistance to psychic damage. In addition, you are immune to fear, and when another creature targets you with an effect that causes the frightened condition, you can use your reaction to turn the fear back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.</p> <p>LIVING NIGHTMARE</p> <p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can tap into a creature\u2019s subconscious fears. As an action, choose a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that isn\u2019t a construct or undead within 60 feet of you. If the creature requires sleep, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failed save, you have gained access to its subconscious mind, though it is not aware of that fact.</p> <p>If the target falls asleep at any point within the next 24 hours, so long as it remains on either the same plane as you or on the Plane of Shadow, you instantly become aware of that fact and can enter a trance as if you cast the dream spell on the target. You must choose the monstrous version of the spell, and you are the messenger. When the target awakens, you are aware it has done so and can choose to immediately teleport to a space within 15 feet of the target that it can see. The target is automatically surprised.</p> <p>Once you use Living Nightmare, you can\u2019t do so again until after a long rest.</p> <p>Noctimancer</p> <p>All shadowcasters understand that shadow is the truest, most fundamental aspect of reality. Take away light, there is darkness; take away heat, there is cold. Noctimancers, or night mages, focus on the shadow that underlies magic. Through their studies, they learn not only to tap into the power of the Plane of Shadow, but to use the underlying reality to manipulate magic itself.</p> <p>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</p> <p>Their ability to weave shadow into other, more traditional forms of magic allows Noctimancers to select from an expanded list when learning shadowcaster spells. The following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell list for you.</p> <p>EMANATIONS UNNATURAL</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup> level detect magic</p> <p>2<sup>nd</sup> level arcanist\u2019s magic aura</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup> level dispel magic</p> <p>ARCANA UNBOUND</p> <p>4<sup>th</sup> level freedom of movement</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup> level eldritch twilight*</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup> level spell echo*</p> <p>THE WEAVE UNMADE</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup> level spell turning*</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup> level antimagic field</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup> level eclipse arcane*</p> <p>*- indicates a new spell presented in this book</p> <p>KNOWLEDGE ARCANE</p> <p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. In addition, you learn to cast comprehend languages and identify as rituals, without requiring material components. You can\u2019t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you\u2019ve learned them by some other means.</p> <p>ELDRITCH WARD</p> <p>At 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Also, when you are targeted by a spell that either requires an attack roll or forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll or to gain advantage on the saving throw. (If a spell involves both an attack roll and a saving throw, you impose disadvantage on the attack roll but gain no benefit on the save.) One you use this ability, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>ARCANE SECRETS</p> <p>At 10<sup>th</sup> level, choose three spells from the wizard spell list that do not also appear on the shadowcaster spell list: one 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell, one 2<sup>nd</sup>-level (or lower) spell, and one 3<sup>rd</sup>-level (or lower) spell. You add these to your spells known, and they are shadowcaster spells for you. At 14<sup>th</sup> level, add one additional wizard spell that does not appear on your shadowcaster spell list, of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower, to your spells known. It is a shadowcaster spell for you.</p> <p>MYSTIC SIPHON</p> <p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you successfully use counterspell, dispel magic, or similar magics to negate an existing spell of 1<sup>st</sup> level or higher cast by another creature, you can capture a shred of the magic you just unwove and bend it to your own purpose. Choose one of the following effects. - If the spell level is 4<sup>th</sup> level or higher, regain a spent shadowcaster spell slot. This spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and then fades away if unused. - Cure one disease afflicting you. - Remove one level of exhaustion afflicting you. - End one of the following conditions afflicting you: blinded, deafened, restrained (if caused by magic), or poisoned. - Make an immediate saving throw against one ongoing effect or condition afflicting you that is ended by a saving throw. If the effect is one that gets worse on a failed save, this extra saving throw does not worsen the effect if it fails. - Gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw made within 1 minute. You can\u2019t choose this option again until you expend the advantage it grants. - Regain 1d6 hit points per level of the spell you countered or dispelled.</p> <p>Shadow Scion</p> <p>Perhaps the most straightforward of the Umbral Ways, the Shadow Scion studies the movement of the Plane of Shadow and the dark energies that permeate it, through its interactions and overlap with the Material Plane. By manipulating planar boundaries they can not only weave magic of shadows, but use the environment of the Plane of Shadow to alter portions of the physical world.</p> <p>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</p> <p>Their studies allow Shadow Scions to select from an expanded list when learning shadowcaster spells. The following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell list for you.</p> <p>BREATH OF THE SHADOW</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup> level fog cloud</p> <p>2<sup>nd</sup> level gust of wind</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup> level sleet storm</p> <p>THE SHADOW LOOMS</p> <p>4<sup>th</sup> level control water</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup> level cone of cold</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup> level move earth</p> <p>THE SHADOW BLEEDS</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup> level ephemeral storm*</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup> level control weather\u2020</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup> level storm of vengeance\u2020</p> <p>*- indicates a new spell presented in this book</p> <p>\u2020-indicates a spell that varies from its standard description (see Shadowcaster Spells)</p> <p>WARDING SHADE</p> <p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, the shadows of the environment lash out on your behalf. You can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you have used this ability, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>CHILD OF TWO WORLDS</p> <p>As of 6<sup>th</sup> level, you no longer suffer exhaustion from extremes of heat or cold, nor do you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to wind or rain. Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can choose to infuse yourself with the essence of the Plane of Shadow. You gain resistance to cold damage and necrotic damage, but vulnerability to radiant damage, until you finish a long rest.</p> <p>FLESH OF SHADOW</p> <p>Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, as an action, you can transform into a shadow elemental. You revert to your normal form after a number of hours equal to half your shadowcaster level, when you spend a bonus action to do so, if you drop to 0 hit points, if you fall unconscious, or if you die. Your game statistics are replaced by those of the elemental, except as follows. You retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the shadow elemental. If the elemental has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the elemental\u2019s bonus instead of yours.</p> <p>When you transform, you assume the elemental\u2019s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.</p> <p>While transformed, you cannot cast spells, though transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you\u2019ve already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell you\u2019ve already cast. You can speak, but only in a whisper, and must be within 10 feet of another creature for it to hear you.</p> <p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the elemental is physically capable of doing so. However, you can\u2019t use any of your special senses unless the elemental also has that sense.</p> <p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with your elemental form has no effect until you leave the form.</p> <p>Once you have used this ability, you can\u2019t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p> <p>MAELSTROM OF SHADOW</p> <p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can draw forth a temporary funnel cloud of shadow-stuff. As an action, choose one 5-foot square within 60 feet that you can see. A column of swirling cloud and darkness descends from the sky (or ceiling) to touch the ground in that space and lasts until the end of your next turn. A creature in the column when it appears, or who enters the column for the first time during a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is restrained.</p> <p>The area is heavily obscured. A creature restrained by the column can\u2019t sense or affect the world outside the column, and nothing outside the column can affect the creature. It sees only swirling darkness, hears only the roar of winds on the Plane of Shadow.</p> <p>At the end of your next turn, just before the funnel vanishes, the creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and 5d10 damage of one other type of your choice: either cold, lightning, or thunder.</p> <p>Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p> <p>Mysteries Of Shadow</p> <p>If a mystery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the mystery at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. If you later cease to meet the prerequisite\u2014perhaps because you\u2019ve traded out a necessary spell or other mystery\u2014you lose all benefits of that mystery until you once again meet the prerequisites. You can only select a given mystery once, unless the mystery description specifies otherwise.</p> <p>ANIMATE SHADOW</p> <p>You can cast unseen servant at will, without requiring material components and without expending a spell slot. Once you have done so, you must finish a short rest before you can do so again. You do not have a shadow during the duration, as it becomes the unseen servant.</p> <p>ASCENDANT SHADE</p> <p>Prerequisite: 11<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>As an action, you gain the benefits of both the levitate and water walk spells with a duration of concentration up to 10 minutes.</p> <p>BALEFUL SHADE</p> <p>Prerequisite: 5<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>You can cast bestow curse once using a shadowcaster spell slot. You can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p> <p>CHILD OF NIGHT</p> <p>You learn the find familiar spell. This spell doesn\u2019t count against your number of spells known.</p> <p>Your familiar, regardless of what form it takes, is clearly a creature of shadow. It is unnaturally dark of hue; wisps of darkness trail from its skin and eyes. It gains darkvision 60 feet (if it doesn\u2019t already have it). While the familiar is in dim light or darkness, attacks against the familiar have disadvantage unless the attacker can see the familiar clearly. While the familiar is in bright light, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p> <p>CREEPING SHADOW</p> <p>Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Initiate-level Paths</p> <p>You learn two additional shadowcaster cantrips, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known column of the shadowcaster table.</p> <p>You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must know three additional qualifying spells each time; you can\u2019t use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once. So, for instance, you could select this mystery a second time once you know spells from six total Initiate Paths, a third time if you know spells from nine, and so forth.</p> <p>DARK CONDUIT</p> <p>Prerequisite: 5<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>You have learned to cast spells through the edges of the Plane of Shadow so that their passage through the Material Plane is warped. As a bonus action, choose a target that you could clearly see at any point since the start of your last turn, but that you can no longer see. Before the end of your turn, you can cast a spell that targets only that creature even if the spell requires you to see your target. In addition, the target gains no benefit of being invisible to you, and it gains no protection from cover against this spell. You must be aware of a target\u2019s presence to use this feature on it.</p> <p>DARKEST CREEPING SHADOW</p> <p>Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Master-level Paths</p> <p>You learn one additional shadowcaster cantrip or 1<sup>st</sup>- level shadowcaster spell (your choice of which), and one additional shadowcaster spell of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known and Spells Known columns of the shadowcaster table.</p> <p>DISTANT VISIONS</p> <p>Prerequisite: 15<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>You can cast clairvoyance without expending a spell slot or requiring components.</p> <p>EMISSARY OF NIGHT</p> <p>You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill, and in your choice of either the Intimidate or Sleight of Hand skill.</p> <p>FUNDAMENTALS OF SHADOW</p> <p>Choose three shadowcaster cantrips that you know. You no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly material components to cast those cantrips (you can still benefit from using an arcane focus).</p> <p>In addition, you can choose to cast one of these cantrips as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a spell as a bonus action using this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing three different cantrips each time.</p> <p>GREATER CREEPING SHADOW</p> <p>Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Intermediate-level Paths</p> <p>You learn one additional shadowcaster cantrip and one 1<sup>st</sup>-level shadowcaster spell, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known and Spells Known columns of the shadowcaster table.</p> <p>You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must know three additional qualifying spells each time; you can\u2019t use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once. So, for instance, you could select this mystery a second time once you know spells from six total Intermediate Paths.</p> <p>GREATER PATH SAVANT</p> <p>Prerequisite: Path Savant</p> <p>Choose an Initiate-level or Intermediate-level Spell Path to which you have already applied the Path Savant mystery. You can cast one spell of 5<sup>th</sup> level or lower from that Path, at your normal shadowcaster spell slot level, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can take this mystery multiple times, applying it to a different qualifying Path each time.</p> <p>GUARDIAN SHADE</p> <p>Prerequisite: 3<sup>rd</sup> level</p> <p>As an action, you animate your own shadow to fight for you in battle. It materializes in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a shadow, with the following alterations: - It is an elemental instead of undead. - It shares your alignment. - It can\u2019t create new shadows.</p> <p>You must concentrate to maintain this effect, as though it were a spell. The shadow remains active until you cease concentrating, until it is reduced to zero hit points, or 1 minute, at which point it returns to its normal form. You don\u2019t cast a shadow for the duration. Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level, you manifest two shadows rather than one. This increases to three at 11<sup>th</sup> level, and four at 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p> <p>LIFE-TAKER</p> <p>Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one cantrip that deals necrotic or cold damage</p> <p>When you cast a cantrip that deals necrotic and/or cold damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage that cantrip deals. If the cantrip affects more than one target, choose which target takes the extra damage.</p> <p>LONGSHADOW</p> <p>When you cast the dancing lights, message, minor illusion, or thaumaturgy cantrip, its range is doubled.</p> <p>MASTER OF DEEPEST SHADOW MAGIC</p> <p>Prerequisite: 15<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, or 8<sup>th</sup> level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using an 8<sup>th</sup>- level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. A spell obtained by this mystery counts as a known spell for purposes of determining whether you\u2019ve completed a Path, and how many Paths you have access to.</p> <p>MASTER OF GREATER SHADOW MAGIC</p> <p>Prerequisite: 13<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using a 7<sup>th</sup>-level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. A spell obtained by this mystery counts as a known spell for purposes of determining whether you\u2019ve completed a Path, and how many Paths you have access to.</p> <p>MASTER OF SHADOW MAGIC</p> <p>Prerequisite: 11<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>Choose one 6<sup>th</sup>-level shadowcaster spell. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using a 6<sup>th</sup>-level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. A spell obtained by this mystery counts as a known spell for purposes of determining whether you\u2019ve completed a Path, and how many Paths you have access to.</p> <p>MASTER OF SUPREME SHADOW MAGIC</p> <p>Prerequisite: 17<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, or 9<sup>th</sup> level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using a 9<sup>th</sup>-level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p> <p>A spell obtained by this Mystery counts as a known spell for purposes of determining whether you\u2019ve completed a Path, and how many Paths you have access to.</p> <p>MELD WITH SHADOWS</p> <p>Prerequisite: 15<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>You can cast invisibility on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or requiring any components.</p> <p>NURTURING DARKNESS</p> <p>If you spend the entirety of a short rest in darkness, and then spend hit dice to regain health, you can roll each die twice and choose the better of the two results. Additionally, if you spend any number of hit dice after a short rest spent in darkness, you can remove one level of exhaustion.</p> <p>PATH SAVANT</p> <p>Prerequisite: At least one complete Spell Path</p> <p>Choose a Spell Path for which you know all three spells. You no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly material components to cast spells from that Path (You can still benefit from using an arcane focus). In addition, you can choose to cast one of these spells as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a spell as a bonus action using this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing three different cantrips each time.</p> <p>SHADOW STEP</p> <p>Prerequisite: 7<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>When you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.</p> <p>STEEL SHADOWS</p> <p>You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. As a bonus action, you can end the spell immediately to gain advantage on one Dexterity (Stealth) check you make before the end of your turn. Once you end the spell in this way, you can\u2019t use Steel Shadows again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>SWIFTER THAN THE EYE</p> <p>Prerequisite: 5<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 bonus action, you can use your action to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action. Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p> <p>TOUCH OF DARKNESS</p> <p>You can cast spider climb on yourself without expending a spell slot. In addition, all ability checks made to track you have disadvantage, and you can walk across water and other liquids, but you must end your turn on solid ground or Touch of Darkness ends immediately.</p> <p>Once you use this mystery, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>When you reach 11<sup>th</sup> level as a shadowcaster, you no longer need to concentrate on spider climb when casting Touch of Darkness.</p> <p>TWILIGHT EXPERTISE</p> <p>Prerequisite: Proficiency in Sleight of Hand or Stealth</p> <p>When you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or (Stealth) check in dim light or darkness, as long as you are proficient in that skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p> <p>UMBRAL MINIONS</p> <p>Prerequisite: 9<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>You can cast conjure umbral servant once using a shadowcaster spell slot. You can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p> <p>WISPS UNWOVEN</p> <p>Prerequisite: 5<sup>th</sup> level</p> <p>You can cast counterspell once using a shadowcaster spell slot. You can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest. shadowCaster</p> <p>Spells</p> <p>As previously described, shadowcaster spells are divided into thematic Paths, as well as by level. Otherwise, they function as any other class spell list in the game. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) are new spells presented in this book.</p> <p>Finally, existing spells marked with a dagger (\u2020) function slightly differently from how they\u2019re described when cast by a shadowcaster.

<p>8<sup>th</sup> level Maze</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup> level Imprisonment\u2020</p> <p>Shadowcaster Spell Descriptions</p> <p>Note that most shadowcaster spells clearly have an element of darkness to them, even if the spell normally would not. Weather effects include unnaturally inky clouds and streams of shadow amidst the precipitation, for instance, while physical objects they create or summon are murky of hue and shot through with inky, fluctuating veins. Only those spells whose effectiveness would be compromised by such obvious effects, such as illusions, lack these traits.</p> <p>ARROW OF DUSK</p> <p>Evocation cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>You launch a bolt of inky darkness at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 points of cold damage and has disadvantage on the next Strength or Dexterity check it makes before the start of your next turn.</p> <p>A living creature reduced to 0 hit points by arrow of dusk falls unconscious and is stable, rather than dying or making death saves.</p> <p>The spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level (2d8), 11<sup>th</sup> level (3d8), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (4d8).</p> <p>BEND PERSPECTIVE (VISIONS AND VEILS)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level divination</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 30 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a small prism)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>Choose a point you can see within range. You create an invisible magical sensor at that spot. You see through the sensor as though you were at that spot. Creatures that can see invisible objects see an eyeball in shades of black and gray.</p> <p>As a bonus action, you can switch your viewpoint to your true position or back to the sensor. If you make an ability check, attack roll or saving throw that relies on Strength or Dexterity while your perspective occupies the sensor, you do so with disadvantage.</p> <p>As an action, you can move the sensor up to 15 feet to another point within range. If you move farther than 30 feet from the sensor, the spell ends.</p> <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p> <p>BLACK CANDLE</p> <p>Illusion cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Touch</p> <p>Components: V, M (a candle wick or a bit of wax)</p> <p>Duration: 1 hour</p> <p>You create a tiny mote of illumination on an object that is no larger than 5 feet in any dimension. The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 5 feet beyond that. Choose up to five creatures when you cast this spell. Only you and the chosen creatures can see or benefit from the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.</p> <p>If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p> <p>CARPET OF SHADOW (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>A thick layer of darkness coats the ground in a 15-foot radius from a point you can see within range. For the duration, the affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the semisolid shadow until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the spell can use its action to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC. On a success it frees itself.</p> <p>Shadowcasters using the Touch of Darkness Mystery are immune to all effects of this spell.</p> <p>CONJURE UMBRAL SERVANT</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 minute</p> <p>Range: 90 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (coal dust and crushed onyx)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p> <p>You call forth a shadow elemental to serve you. In all other respects, this spell is identical to conjure elemental.</p> <p>CONTROL WEATHER (THE SHADOW BLEEDS)</p> <p>When casting control weather as a shadowcaster spell, you cannot raise the temperature to hotter than \u201ccool,\u201d and you cannot reduce precipitation to less than \u201covercast or ground fog.\u201d Otherwise, the spell functions as normal.</p> <p>CURTAIN OF GLOOM (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 90 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a few black or gray threads)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you can see within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 40 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall is opaque, and its area is heavily obscured by magical darkness.</p> <p>Passing through the wall is particularly disorienting. Each time a creature enters the wall or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the rest of the creature\u2019s movement is in the opposite direction the creature intended. Creatures that do not rely on sight, can see in magical darkness, or are native to the Plane of Shadow are immune to this effect of the wall.</p> <p>DANCING SHROUD (WRITHING GLOOM)</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a short length of black rope or cord)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You summon wisps and tendrils of semisolid shadow in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within range. The shadows are difficult terrain and can impede up to six creatures of your choice that you can see. When the spell is cast and when a chosen creature starts its turn in the area, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p> <p>On a failed save, the creature is restrained. If a creature restrained in this way attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the spell fails, and the spell slot or usage is lost. It can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.</p> <p>DOUSE</p> <p>Transmutation cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous, or up to 1 hour</p> <p>You infuse the light before you with shade. All nonmagical light sources the size of a campfire or smaller in a 60-foot cube originating from you are affected. Choose one of the following options: Affected light sources now shed dim light out to the range they normally shed bright light for 1 hour. Creatures have resistance to any fire damage shed by affected light sources. You can extinguish one light source in the area, causing it to shed no light. If the light source was fire, the fire goes out. If the sources were some other form of nonmagical light such as luminous fungi, they are extinguished for 1 hour. As a bonus action, you can end the effects of the spell (extinguished flames don\u2019t reignite). Small or larger creatures who produce nonmagical light are immune to this spell.</p> <p>DUSK AND DAWN (SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self (30-foot radius)</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 1 hour</p> <p>You can raise or lower the ambient light within range by one \u201cstep\u201d\u2014changing bright light or darkness to dim light, or changing dim light to bright light or darkness. At any time during the duration, you can spend an action to change the level again (though you can never change it to two \u201csteps\u201d beyond its ambient level).</p> <p>Darkvision and magical light function normally in dim light and darkness created by this spell. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the radius of the effect increases by 15 feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p> <p>ECLIPSE ARCANE (THE WEAVE UNMADE) 9<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self (60-foot radius)</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>All ongoing spells of 7<sup>th</sup> level or lower within the radius are automatically dispelled, as per dispel magic. For each spell of 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> level in the area, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u2019s level. On a successful check, the spell ends. When casting eclipse arcane, you can choose to exclude any spell effects currently affecting you or objects in your possession.</p> <p>ELDRITCH TWILIGHT (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p> <p>Shadowy tendrils intertwined with threads of magic expand in a 20-foot sphere from a point you can see within range. The area becomes dim light for the duration. The mystic shadows interfere with spellcasting. A creature within the area that attempts to cast a spell, or a creature outside the area that casts a spell targeting anything in the area, must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. Targets proficient in the Arcana skill can add their proficiency bonus to the roll, even if their spellcasting ability is not Intelligence. On a failure, the spell fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted. Shadowcasters who are outside the spell\u2019s area can cast their spells into the area normally.</p> <p>EPHEMERAL IMAGE</p> <p>(DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 1,000 miles</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours</p> <p>You create a duplicate of yourself, made up semisolid shadow, anywhere within range that you can see or have seen before. This functions identically to the spell project image, with the following alterations: - Because the illusion is semisolid, mild physical interaction with it does not reveal it to be an illusion. A successful attack, or a creature that uses its action to physically examine the image and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC reveals the image\u2019s true nature. - The image can manipulate small objects, as per the mage hand spell. - You can cast spells of 5<sup>th</sup> level or lower through the image, as though you occupied its space. - The illusion can fly at its normal speed (twice your walking speed). If you restrict its movement in a given round to half that speed, you can cause it to move as a bonus action rather than a normal action. - If the illusion takes damage, you can make a Constitution saving throw as if you took the damage dealt to the image. If you succeed, the illusion doesn\u2019t disappear.</p> <p>EPHEMERAL STORM</p> <p>(THE SHADOW BLEEDS)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 200 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>A tumult of slicing shadows and white lightning crash down from the heavens in a 15-foot radius around a point you can see within range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 lightning damage and 5d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p>When you cast the spell, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to be unaffected by it.</p> <p>FAR SIGHT (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup>-level divination</p> <p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a mirror or reflective ball made of polished obsidian, worth at least 1,500 gp)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>This spell functions as scrying, but you also gain the benefits ofcomprehend languages, detect magic, and true seeing through the sensor.</p> <p>FLAME BLADE (FORGED OF NIGHT)</p> <p>When you cast flame blade as a shadowcaster spell, the blade created is a twisting saber life-draining gloom. The spell deals necrotic damage.</p> <p>FLICKERING MOTES</p> <p>Evocation cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Up to 8 hours</p> <p>Choose one creature within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is beset with tiny shadows at the corner of its vision. The target has disadvantage on the next Intelligence or Wisdom check it makes, or on its passive Perception against the next Dexterity (Stealth) check made to hide from it. The spell then ends.</p> <p>The spell ends if you cast it again.</p> <p>HELLISH REBUKE</p> <p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p> <p>When you cast hellish rebuke as a shadowcaster spell, the spell causes the target to writhe in frigid shadows. The spell deals your choice of cold or necrotic damage.</p> <p>HYPNOTIC SHADE (WRITHING GLOOM)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 90 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror, polished coin, or other means of creating a flickering light)</p> <p>Duration: 1 minute</p> <p>A writhing, shifting pattern of shadow appears at a point you can see within range. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 30 feet of the chosen point, and who can see it, are affected in ascending order of their current hit points. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is charmed until the spell ends. A creature charmed in this way is paralyzed. The charmed condition ends if the creature takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature out of its stupor. Subtract each creature\u2019s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p> <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot above first.</p> <p>IMPRISONMENT (WORLDS APART)</p> <p>When you cast imprisonment as a shadowcaster spell, you</p> <p>must select either the \u201cburial\u201d or \u201chedged prison\u201d options.</p> <p>INFINITE MIRROR (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level divination</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror or prism)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to ten minutes</p> <p>You instantly become aware of and can see any magical sensors (such as arcane eye, or those created by clairvoyance or scrying) currently observing you, or that begin to observe you during the duration. As an action, you can focus on a sensor and force that spell\u2019s caster to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose one of the following options:</p> <p>The spell used to create the sensor ends.</p> <p>You create a sensor and observe the caster as if you successfully cast the scrying spell on them. If the caster ceases concentration on their spell, you can choose to maintain it as long as you concentrate on infinite mirror, allowing both of you to continue observing through your sensors as normal. You can use this option on only one spell at a time, and you can end your observation on an existing spell at any time.</p> <p>A creature that succeeds on its saving throw can\u2019t be affected by this casting ofinfinite mirror.</p> <p>INVESTITURE OF SHADOW</p> <p>(HANDS OF DUSK)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>Darkness suffuses your body for the duration, granting you the following benefits. - You have resistance to cold and necrotic damage. - Your walking speed increases by 20, you gain a climb speed equal to your new walking speed, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1-inch wide. - You can use your action to create a wave of darkness that fills the area within 15 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 cold and 2d8 necrotic damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not blinded on a successful one.</p> <p>LIFE FADES (TOUCH OF TWILIGHT)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level necromancy</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 15 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature that isn\u2019t a construct or undead within range. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from this spell can\u2019t exceed two levels. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above first.</p> <p>LIQUID NIGHT</p> <p>Conjuration cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Touch</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a vial, bottle, bowl, or other container to hold the ink)</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>You cause the shadows to coalesce into a small quantity of ink in an empty container you are holding. This creates enough ink to write a page\u2019s worth of text. It is not of sufficient quality to be used for scribing spells. When you cast the spell, you can decide if the ink behaves normally, or if it glows a faint red in dim light or darkness. In the latter case, the ink and anything written or drawn with it sheds dim light out to 5 feet.</p> <p>If you cast this spell again before the ink is used to write, paint, stain, or dye something, the previous casting\u2019s worth of ink disappears.</p> <p>NIGHTFIRE (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p> <p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (ash from a fire that was doused rather than burning itself out)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>An eerie black and gray flame erupts from the ground in a 5-foot sphere centered on a point you can see. The flame sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p> <p>When a creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on its turn, or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 1d10 cold damage and 1d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much of each on a successful one. In addition, the creature is limned in ghostly flame until the start of its next tur while so illuminated, the creature cannot benefit from invisibility and has disadvantage on Stealth checks. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the flame up to 60 feet in any direction.</p> <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, either the cold or necrotic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot above second.</p> <p>OBSCURING SHADOWS</p> <p>(TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p> <p>4<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 20 feet</p> <p>Components: V</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You wrap twisting shadows around up to six creatures within range that you can see. All attack rolls against a target obscured by this spell have disadvantage. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn\u2019t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p> <p>PASS INTO SHADOW (EBON ROADS)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Touch</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (an uncut jet or onyx worth at least 200 gp)</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to the Plane of Shadow. Other than allowing passage to only that single plane, pass into shadow otherwise functions as the spell plane shift.</p> <p>POWER WORD FEAR (DREAD SOUL)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level enchantment</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>You speak a dread word of power that causes inescapable, soul-deep panic to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to overwhelming terror. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being frightened.</p> <p>While the target is affected by this numbing terror, the target must move before taking any other action each turn, and it must move as far from you as possible. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws other than Wisdom saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted.</p> <p>A target suffering this fear can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p> <p>PRISON OF NIGHT (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 100 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a rod of polished jet or onyx worth at least 400 gp)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p> <p>You create a 10-foot cube of opaque shadow centered on a point you can see. The cube blocks line of sight. When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage\u2019s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the cube and must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p>As an action, a creature can attempt to push through the shadowy walls by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. A creature that touches the cube takes 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage.</p> <p>SCREEN (DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p> <p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 24 hours</p> <p>You create an entire illusory scene, complete with sights, sounds, scents, and even feel, which can be as large as a 100-foot cube within range. Within that area, you can make terrain and structures appear however you like. You can create illusory creatures, who behave as you describe, and you can decide whether real creatures, objects, or structures are visible or invisible on an individual basis. You set the descriptions and behavior of illusory creatures, and cloak existing creatures when you cast the spell and can\u2019t change these decisions later. A creature made invisible by this spell that makes an attack, damages a creature, or forces a creature to make a saving throw becomes visible. Each round on your turn, harmful images created by the spell can deal 1d8 psychic damage to up to six creatures interacting with them according to the parameters you set. The creatures believe the damage takes the form of whatever is appropriate; a wolf\u2019s ripping jaws, burns from lava, crushing boulders tumbling down a cliff, etc.</p> <p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the area\u2019s true form; but all other aspects of the illusion remain, so creatures can still physically interact with the illusion, which appears hazy and translucent to them. Creatures, objects, or pieces of terrain created by the illusion vanish if they leave the area.</p> <p>SHADOW FORM (CLOAK OF SHADE)</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a bit of smooth obsidian or dark glass)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p> <p>You become a living shadow, appearing as a dark, wavering silhouette of yourself. Equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form. You can\u2019t use or benefit from any equipment while a shadow. While in this form, your walking speed is reduced by 10, but you gain a climb speed equal to your reduced walking speed. While in dim light or darkness you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks; and gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, as well as on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You gain vulnerability to radiant damage, and when in bright light, attacks against you gain advantage. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If you fall, you do so slowly. You fall 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</p> <p>While in this form, you can\u2019t make weapon attacks, cast spells, or manipulate objects or creatures. You can speak, but only in a rough whisper.</p> <p>For the duration, you can make a special draining attack as an action. Make a melee spell attack with a reach of 15 feet. If you hit, the target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 necrotic damage.</p> <p>SHADOW OUT OF TIME</p> <p>(SHADOW\u2019S EMBRACE)</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 3 rounds</p> <p>You transport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying to an isolated pocket of the Plane of Shadow where time moves faster. This pocket is a cylindrical space 20 feet wide and 20 feet high. It is blank and featureless, save for a small planar window that shows the area you just left. The window allows observation only; you can\u2019t interact in any way through the window, and the window is invisible from the other side. During each turn you take in the pocket, you can take three turns worth of actions. Creatures observed through the window appear to move in slow motion.</p> <p>While in the shadow pocket, you can only affect yourself and objects you brought with you. You can end the spell early as an action. When the spell ends, you reappear on the Material Plane in an unoccupied space anywhere within 1,000 feet of the spot where you cast the spell.</p> <p>SHADOW PUPPETS (HANDS OF DUSK)</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You summon a broad swathe of coiling, grasping shadows. Choose a point you can see within range; the shadows occupy a 30-foot-radius sphere from that point. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain for your enemies. At the start of each of your turns, each enemy within 10 feet of a light source within the radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d12 cold damage if the light source is a fire or otherwise radiates heat, or 2d12 necrotic damage if the light source is magical or otherwise radiates no heat.</p> <p>At the start of your turn, choose one creature within the area. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled by the shadows. The creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can command the shadows to lash out against one creature within the area. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 cold damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p>SHROUD OF NIGHTMARE</p> <p>(CLOAK OF SHADE)</p> <p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Touch</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 10 minutes</p> <p>You touch a willing creature, surrounding it with a flickering aura of shade. For the duration, when the target makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. A creature that forces the target to make one of those saving throws immediately takes 2d8 psychic damage.</p> <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2<sup>nd</sup>, to a maximum of 4d8.</p> <p>SPELL ECHO (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p> <p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 120 feet, and see text</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Special; see text</p> <p>Choose any spell of 4<sup>th</sup>-level or lower, with a casting time of 1 action or less, that was cast by another creature within range since the end of your last turn. You must have been able to see the caster and any effect of the spell itself. You immediately duplicate that spell, targeting it as you choose, and using your own abilities, and spell save DC. It follows all the normal rules of range, targeting, school, duration, concentration, and so forth, though you are not required to provide any material components.</p> <p>At Higher Level. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you can duplicate a spell of one level higher than fourth for each slot level above 6<sup>th</sup>.</p> <p>SPELL TURNING (THE WEAVE UNMADE)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p> <p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p> <p>A murky aura surrounds you, reflecting certain spells back at the caster. Only spells that specifically target you are affected; spells that affect an area which happens to include you are not.</p> <p>Roll 1d4+6 when you cast this spell; this is the total number of spell levels the aura can reflect. When you are targeted by a spell, it instead affects the caster as though they were the target, and you subtract the spell\u2019s level from the number of levels remaining. When you run out of levels remaining, the spell ends.</p> <p>If you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the levels remaining to your spell turning, you may suffer only a partial effect, or reflect only a partial effect. If the levels remaining to your spell turning equal half or less than half of the spell\u2019s level, you suffer a partial effect; if the levels remaining are greater than half the spell\u2019s level, the caster suffers a partial effect.</p> <p>When someone suffers a spell\u2019s partial effect, they have advantage on any applicable saves, take only half of any damage, and the spell\u2019s maximum duration is halved. If both you and the caster are under the effect of spell turning, you both subtract half the spell\u2019s level from your remaining total and are both subject to a partial effect as described above.</p> <p>SPIRIT GUARDIANS</p> <p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p> <p>When you cast spirit guardians, as a shadowcaster spell, the spirits appear as featureless, shadowy silhouettes, and deal necrotic damage, regardless of your alignment.</p> <p>Storm of Vengeance (The Shadow Bleeds)</p> <p>When you cast storm of vengeance as a shadowcaster spell, the rain in round two is shadow hail, dealing your choice of cold or necrotic damage rather than acid damage as per normal.</p> <p>TWILIGHT TENDRIL</p> <p>Evocation cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 20 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Instantaneous</p> <p>A tendril of shadow lashes out at one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved 10 feet in any direction you choose, and then take 1d6 points of cold damage.</p> <p>This spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level (2d6), 11<sup>th</sup> level (3d6), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (4d6).</p> <p>UMBRAL DOPPELGANGER</p> <p>(BORN OF NIGHT)</p> <p>8<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p> <p>You send one creature that you can see within range to a pocket of the Plane of Shadow, while simultaneously summoning a shadowy duplicate of that creature to act on your behalf. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the target is not banished, and the duplicate appears in the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target and disappears at the end of its own turn. On a failed save, the target disappears, reappearing in the Plane of Shadow, while the duplicate appears in the space the target vacated. While in the Plane of Shadow, the target is incapacitated.</p> <p>When it first appears, the duplicate is statistically identical to the target except for the following distinctions: The duplicate has resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage. - All damage caused by the duplicate is either cold or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the spell), rather than the standard type caused by its weapons, spells, or other features. - The duplicate can only cast spells/duplicate spell effects up to 6<sup>th</sup> level, whether on its own or via magic items, even if the original creature can cast or create higher-level magics. - Any of the duplicate\u2019s equipment that is removed or dropped disappears at the start of the duplicate\u2019s next turn, unless the duplicate takes possession of it before then. The duplicate acts on the target creature\u2019s initiative, losing all ties, and is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to the duplicate, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p> <p>The banished creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, or when the spell ends, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target returns before the spell ends, the duplicate disappears at the end of its next turn and the spell ends. The target and the duplicate have advantage on attack rolls against one another.</p> <p>UMBRAL FORM (SHADOW\u2019S EMBRACE)</p> <p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 8 hours</p> <p>You step into the dimensional overlap between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow. With the exception of involving the Plane of Shadow instead of the Ethereal Plane, this otherwise functions in all respect as the spell etherealness.</p> <p>UMBRAL HORDE (BORN OF NIGHT)</p> <p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 60 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: 1 round/2 rounds; see text</p> <p>Choose up to five creatures within range; each target must attempt a Constitution save. On a failure, a target is banished to the Plane of Shadow and replaced by a dark duplicate, as per umbral doppelganger. On a success, the target is not banished, but the duplicate still appears adjacent to them.</p> <p>The duplicates act as a group, immediately after you in the initiative order. If a target succeeded on its saving throw, that target\u2019s duplicate vanishes at the end of its turn Targets sent to the Plane of Shadow are incapacitated and return at the end of your next turn. Their duplicates then disappear at the end of their own next turn. The duplicates function in all ways as described in umbral doppelganger.</p> <p>UMBRAL TOOL (FORGED OF NIGHT)</p> <p>1<sup>st</sup>-level conjuration</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>You summon a tool made of shadow into your free hand. This can be any mundane, simple tool: a hammer, a crowbar, a chisel, a saw, and so forth. It functions exactly like the real thing in all respects, and you can even pass it off to a companion for their own use.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can create a simple, one-handed weapon instead of a tool. It doesn\u2019t count as magical for overcoming resistance or immunity to damage.</p> <p>The items created by this spell are somewhat rough and lacking in detail, so if you use it to duplicate tools that require precision\u2014such as thieves\u2019 tools or calligrapher\u2019s tools\u2014you have disadvantage on checks made while using them.</p> <p>VAMPIRIC WALL (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p> <p>5<sup>th</sup>-level necromancy</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 90 feet</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a few bloodstained black or gray threads)</p> <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p> <p>You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall is opaque, but creatures and objects can pass through it. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Choose one creature that took damage from the wall. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage taken by that creature. When a creature enters the wall\u2019s area for the first time on a turn, or ends its turn there, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</p> <p>Each time the wall deals necrotic damage due to a creature entering its area or ending a turn there, the length of the wall is reduced by 5 feet. If the length reaches 0, the spell ends.</p> <p>VENGEFUL SHADE</p> <p>Necromancy cantrip</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: 30 feet</p> <p>Components: V, M (a weapon)</p> <p>Duration: 1 round</p> <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell\u2019s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack\u2019s normal effects, and is surrounded by dancing, writhing ribbons of shadow until the start of your next turn. If, before that time, the creature targets you with an attack or spell, or ends its movement closer to you than when it started, it immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage and the spell ends.</p> <p>This spell\u2019s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5<sup>th</sup> level, the weapon attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for targeting or closing on you increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11<sup>th</sup> level and 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p> <p>WINDOWS OF SHADE</p> <p>(SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p> <p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p> <p>Casting Time: 1 action</p> <p>Range: Self</p> <p>Components: V, S, M (a pinch of coal dust)</p> <p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p> <p>You gain the ability to see normally in darkness, even magical darkness, out to 60 feet.</p> <p>At any point during the duration, you can spend a bonus action to end the spell and make a gaze attack against any living creature you can see, and that can see you, within 60 feet. The target takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. The creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns; if it can\u2019t see you, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the effect ends</p> <p>Shadow Elemental</p> <p>The incarnated life forces of earth, air, fire, and water that exist on the elemental planes, that become traditional elementals when summoned to the Material World, have their own dark reflections on the Plane of Shadows. Initially mindless echoes, literal shadows, they eventually developed rudimentary awareness of their own. These have become so-called shadow elementals, entities of living shade, formed from the stuff of the Plane of Shadow. Nebulous Form. Unlike true elementals, shadow elementals maintain a semi-physical form at all times, even when unsummoned and freely roaming the Plane of Shadow. This form is constantly shifting, ranging from a blot of darkness all but invisible in the gloom of their home realm, to looming, almost-but-not-quite humanoid silhouettes. Even in the brightest illumination, which shadow elementals find deeply unpleasant, their boundaries are inky and indistinct, like a haze or a dark watercolor painting.</p> <p>Loathing of Light and Life. Both the gleam of excess light and the warmth of living beings bring shadow elementals pain, and thus they lash out and seek to destroy the source of their discomfort. Like true elementals, they resent being summoned and forced into servitude, but they possess a hostility beyond even the capricious and often destructive instincts of more natural spirits. This doesn\u2019t make them more difficult to control, but shadow elementals do tend toward more of what mortal beings would consider evil behaviors when free to act as they please.</p> <p>Alone in the Dark. Shadow elementals are solitary entities. They aren\u2019t hostile toward one another, but neither do they seek to congregate; if two or more find themselves in the same vicinity, they tend to simply ignore one another. While they show some understanding of all the various elemental languages, as well as the commands of any who summon them regardless of language, they appear to have no tongue of their own. If they are capable of speech or communication at all, no one has ever observed it. Elemental Nature. A shadow elemental doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p> <p>Shadow Elemental</p> <p>Large elemental, neutral evil</p> <p>Armor Class 14 (natural armor)</p> <p>Hit Points 102 (12d10+36)</p> <p>Speed 50 ft., climb 50 ft.</p> <p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p> <p>10 (+0) 17 (+3) 17 (+3) 7 (-2) 10 (+0) 8 (-1)</p> <p>Skills: Stealth +6</p> <p>Damage Vulnerabilities: radiant</p> <p>Damage Resistances: cold; bludgeoning, piercing, and</p> <p>slashing from nonmagical attacks</p> <p>Damage Immunities: necrotic, poison</p> <p>Condition Immunities: exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, unconscious</p> <p>Senses: blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 10</p> <p>Languages understands Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran, and the language of its summoner, but can\u2019t speak</p> <p>Challenge 5 (1,800 XP)</p> <p>Light Sensitivity. </p> <p>While in bright light, the elemental has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p> <p>Shadow Form. </p> <p>The elemental can enter a hostile creature\u2019s space and stop there.

The effect also ends if the target takes 10 points of fire or radiant damage from a single source.

In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one cackles loudly at what she sees.</p> <p>A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure noone is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree\u2019s bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavy-set boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>A young elf intently mutters something underneath his breath each time he exhales. Visible only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to its knees in agony.</p> <p>Witches are stricken by magic so dark it imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence. Through force of personality alone, they can spin this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar with their thoughts.</p> <p>Cursed</p> <p>While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With gruesome effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torture which plagues them.</p> <p>Pariahs and Outcasts</p> <p>Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night. As a result, known witches are in great personal danger and can usually be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them.</p> <p>In reality, very few choose to become witches, and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer, to healer, to apothecary. Being accused as a witch carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of the claim, so wise witches relocate frequently, never residing in one place for too long.</p> <p>Familiar Masters</p> <p>It is rare to find a witch without his or her constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch\u2019s familiar is ubiquitous to common folk for good reason. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters.</p> <p>Creating a Witch</p> <p>Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful, malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a bloodline of witches, or did another spellcaster use sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide on the nature of your witch\u2019s curse and think about how you relate to it. Do you feel like the curse was secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance burn in your heart?</p> <p>What negative effects does the curse leverage on your personality and mind? Are you haunted by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive thoughts? How do you feel manipulating the power of this curse outwards into hexes and spells? Work with your GM to determine how witches are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned, and persecuted? Are you an openly-known witch? Do the other characters in your party know of your witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to conceal the true darkness of their magic.</p> <p>QUICK BUILD</p> <p>To build a witch quickly, make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Then, choose the chill touch and minor illusion cantrips, and the spells hideous laughter and thunderwave.

You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p> <p>SPELL SLOTS</p> <p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1<sup>st</sup> level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell bane and have a 1<sup>st</sup>-level and a 2<sup>nd</sup>-level spell slot available, you can cast bane using either slot.</p> <p>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL OR HIGHER</p> <p>You know two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice.</p> <p>Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> level.</p> <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p> <p>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</p> <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself, where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p> <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p> <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p> <p>RITUAL CASTING</p> <p>You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p> <p>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</p> <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.</p> <p>Witch\u2019s Curse</p> <p>You are wracked by a terrible curse which infects your body and soul. At 1<sup>st</sup> level, choose the form that this curse takes from the options below.</p> <p>Burned. Almost all of your body has been scorched by arcane flames, leaving you with striking black scars and embers of magic that burn under the skin. As a result, you have resistance to fire damage, and you know the cantrip produce flame, which does not count against your total number of cantrips known.</p> <p>Drowned. Water fills your lungs, and yet you do not die. You can breathe air and water. Additionally, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p> <p>Feral. Through your curse, you have forgotten the manners and customs of civilized men and gone to live among beasts in the wild. Hunting and fighting daily, you have become savage. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Additionally, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier.</p> <p>Hideous. Your appearance is ghastly to behold. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. When you roll initiative, you can choose one humanoid you can see to scare. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened until the end of your next turn.</p> <p>Hollow. Your soul has been divorced from your body, trapping you in a limbo between life and death. When you or your familiar reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you drain some of its life force, and gain temporary hit points equal to your witch level + Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).</p> <p>Infested. You are constantly followed by vermin, like insects and rats, which crawl on your skin and swarm in your wake. As a result, you are immune to being diseased.</p> <p>Additionally, you can command these pests as your own. Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can choose the form of a swarm of rats for your familiar. Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, you can choose a swarm of insects.</p> <p>Loveless. You are cursed to never find true love. Jaded and disaffected, not even magic can turn your heart; as a result, you are immune to being charmed.</p> <p>Possessed. Your soul is occupied by a foreign spirit that sometimes tries to wrest away your consciousness. However, while you sleep, the spirit whispers magical secrets to you. You learn an additional witch spell at a level for which you have spell slots at 1<sup>st</sup> level, and again at 4<sup>th</sup> level, 8<sup>th</sup> level, and 12<sup>th</sup> level. These spells do not count against your total number of spells known.</p> <p>Starving. No matter how much you eat, food turns to ash in your mouth. Your curse nourishes you, but only at the edge of starvation, and you are constantly wracked by pangs of hunger. You don\u2019t need to eat or drink, but can still imbibe and benefit from potions. Additionally, you are immune to being poisoned.</p> <p>Visions. You are cursed to have terrible visions of the future, presaging the death of your friends, family, and yourself. However many of these visions are cruel deceptions, they are sometimes grimly accurate. You can add your Charisma modifier, in addition to your Dexterity modifier, to your initiative rolls.</p> <p>Whispers. Unseen voices murmer in your ears at all times. As such, you can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don\u2019t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathy, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p> <p>Hexes</p> <p>You can learn a number of powerful incantations, known as hexes, derived from the same insidious magic which cursed you.</p> <p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you gain two hexes of your choice. Your hex options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain witch levels, you gain additional hexes of your choice, as shown in the Hexes Known column of the Witch table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hexes you know and replace it with another hex.</p> <p>Unless otherwise stated, if a hex calls for an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack bonus or spell save DC. All hexes require verbal or somatic components (caster\u2019s choice at the time of casting.)</p> <p>Unless otherwise noted, if a hex lasts for a duration, you concentrate on it as you would a spell. You can concentrate on a hex and a spell at the same time, and you make only one Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both.</p> <p>Cackle</p> <p>At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your bonus action to cackle. The duration of your hex extends by 1 round for each creature affected within 60 feet of you. Not all witches laugh maniacally when they cackle, but all cackles require a verbal component, as a spell. These range from mundane curses and insults, to the murmuring of dead languages and speaking backwards.</p> <p>Familiar</p> <p>At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual without material components. The spell doesn\u2019t count against your number of spells known. The spell is improved in the following ways: \u2022 Your familiar takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice). \u2022 Once per turn as an action or a bonus action, you can mentally command your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack. \u2022 When you cast a spell, you can deliver it through your familiar as if it had cast the spell, even if the spell doesn\u2019t have a range of touch. \u2022 When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: death snail*, flying book*, homunculus, mock*, moon jelly*, pet rock*, pseudodragon, rag doll*, sprite, tin soldier*, winter wolf pup*, and yarn golem*. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk are in Appendix C. Witch\u2019s Craft Your knowledge of magic has culminated in learning a Craft, an innate variety of magic which exists apart from the schools of magic. When you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level, choose one Witch\u2019s Craft. Your choice grants you features at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, and again at 6<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> level. If your craft grants you a hex at any level, it doesn't count against your total number of hexes known. CRAFT SPELLS Each craft is associated with a branch of arcana, represented by a number of spells which you learn. The levels of these spells are noted in the craft description. These spells count as witch spells for you and don\u2019t count against your total number of spells known. WITCH FAMILIAR As a witch, familiars you summon are imbued with your insidious magic, granting them the following benefits: \u2022 Your familiar can use your spell attack bonus for its attack rolls. \u2022 Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, saving throws, and damage rolls. \u2022 You add twice your witch level to your familiar\u2019s maximum hit points. Insidious Spell Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a witch spell that affects a creature that is under the effect of your hex, that creature has disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell. This feature only applies to a hostile creature which is the sole target of your hex. Improved Familiar At 7<sup>th</sup> level, your familiar\u2019s attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity. Additionally, you can choose the following forms for your familiar: brass dragon wyrmling (without its breath weapon), fright*, grep*, imp, or quasit. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk are in Appendix C. Dying Curse Beginning at 9<sup>th</sup> level, when a creature reduces you to 0 hit points but does not kill you outright, you can lay a nefarious curse upon them. The creature is cursed for up to 24 hours. While cursed, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. If you regain consciousness or the creature is targeted by the remove curse spell, the curse ends at the end of the creature\u2019s next turn. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. Grand Hex By 11<sup>th</sup> level, you have perfected deeply malevolent forms of magic. You learn one Grand Hex, and you learn another at 13<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> level. Grand hexes are detailed at the end of the class description. Hexmaster By 20<sup>th</sup> level, you have mastered your foul magic. Humanoid creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your hexes. HEXES The Hexes below are presented in alphabetical order. ABATE As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can\u2019t take reactions until the end of your next turn. APATHY As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, until the end of your next turn, the creature becomes indifferent toward one creature of your choice that it is hostile towards. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell by the creature to which it is indifferent. When the hex ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise. BECKON FAMILIAR You can cast the find familiar spell as an action without expending a spell slot or spell components. Once you cast this spell in this manner, you can\u2019t do so again for 1 minute. You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex. BLEEDING As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, each time this creature takes damage, it loses an additional 1d4 hit points. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. CHARM As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you until the end of your next turn. When the hex ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you. DIRE FAMILIAR As an action, you can bolster your summoned familiar. For 1 minute, your familiar\u2019s current and maximum hit points is increased by twice your witch level and it gains a bonus to its damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. You can cast other hexes while this hex is in effect. Once you cast this hex, you can\u2019t cast it again until your familiar is dismissed, or until its duration expires. You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex. DISORIENT As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, whenever this target makes an attack roll before the end of your next turn, it must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll. DOOMWARD As an action, choose one friendly creature other than yourself you can see within 60 feet. If this creature drops to 0 hit points before the end of your next turn and doesn\u2019t die outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. This hex then ends and can\u2019t be used to target the same creature until you finish a short or long rest. DUPLICITY As an action, you can create an illusory duplicate self, composed of shadowstuff, to confuse your enemies. When a creature attacks you, roll any die. On an odd number, the attack strikes the duplicate and misses, regardless of its roll, and the hex ends. On an even roll, the attack targets you as normal. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. EVIL EYE As an action, choose one creature you can see that can see you within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. FORTUNE As an action, choose one friendly creature other than yourself you can see within 60 feet. The creature has advantage on saving throws until the end of your next turn. GO UNSEEN As an action, you and your familiar become invisible. The effect ends at the end of your next turn, or if you or your familiar attack or cast a spell. Once you cast this hex, you can\u2019t cast it again for 1 minute. HOBBLE As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\u2019s movement speed is reduced to 10 feet until the end of your next turn. If the creature is flying, it falls. KNOWING As an action, you open your third eye and become intuitively aware of your surroundings. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) rolls until the end of your next turn. Additionally, choose of the following pieces of information: \u2022 If a creature can speak a language \u2022 If a creature is at or below half its maximum hit points \u2022 What a creature\u2019s lowest ability score is You learn that piece of information for each creature within 30 feet. You can only learn one of these things about a creature, even if you cast this hex more than once. HEXES AND MAGIC A witch casts their terrible hexes as an extension of their curse. As their curses are magical in nature, their hexes are considered 0<sup>th</sup>-level spells for the purposes of feature and spells, such as counterspell or dispel magic, which interact with magic. Furthermore, all hexes cease while in the area of an antimagic field or similar effect. MIRE As an action, you can transform the ground within 30 feet of where you cast this hex into murky swamp, which is difficult terrain. You can move without penalty in this area. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. MISFORTUNE As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. Until the end of your next turn, whenever this creature rolls a 20 on a d20 roll, the roll instead becomes a 1. OBFUSCATE As an action, you create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. PEACEBOND As an action, you can lock weapons to their owners. The weapons and ammunition of each creature within 30 feet become locked in their sheaths, quivers, or holsters until the end of your next turn. During this time, a creature can use its action to free its weapon with a Strength check, opposed by your spell save DC. POX As an action, choose one creature you can see within 5 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the end of your next turn. RUIN As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\u2019s Armor Class decreases by 3, to a minimum of 10, until the end of your next turn. SCURRY As an action, a nonmagical object you choose within 30 feet sprouts legs and runs away. You can\u2019t target an object that weighs more than 10 pounds, nor can you target one that is being worn as clothing or armor; however, you can target certain objects that are being carried, as long as they are not affixed entirely around a creature\u2019s body and are not being held in a hand. For example, you can\u2019t target a creature\u2019s helmet or a sword it is wielding, but you can target a drawstring pouch it is wearing or a dagger that is sheathed at its side. The object animates, wriggles free of its owner, if it has one, sprouts two legs, and moves 20 feet in a direction you choose. At the beginning of your turn, you can choose which direction the object moves. The object has an AC of 10, if its AC was not already higher, and remains animated until the end of your next turn, or until it is picked up. SHRIEK As a bonus action, you can release a thunderous, blood-curdling screech. Each Large or smaller creature you choose within 5 feet of you is pushed 5 feet away from you. SLUMBER As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target falls unconscious until it takes damage, or until the end of your next turn. Undead, creatures which are immune to being charmed, and creatures whose current hit points are greater than five times your witch level are immune to this effect. SLUR As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can\u2019t speak coherently until the end of your next turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell that requires a verbal component, it must roll a d20. On an odd roll, the casting fails. TREMORS As an action, you can create a small quake. Each creature on the ground within 10 feet of you must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. WARD As an action, choose 1 creature you can see other than yourself within 60 feet. Each time the creature takes damage before the end of your next turn, it reduces the damage it takes by 3. GRAND HEXES The Grand Hexes below are presented in alphabetical order. Unless otherwise stated, if a grand hex calls for an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack bonus or spell save DC. Grand hex features do not count as hexes. CAULDRON You can brew potions in a bubbling cauldron using raw components scavenged from nature. To this end, you have a pool of alchemy points equal to half your witch level, rounded down. You regain all expended alchemy points when you finish a long rest. You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of alchemy points to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. The potions available for you to brew are given on the Cauldron Potions table below. Cauldron Potions Potion Alchemy Points Potion of Animal Friendship 1 Potion of Growth 1 Potion of Healing 1 Potion of Water Breathing 1 Oil of Slipperiness 2 Philter of Love 2 Potion of Greater Healing 2 Potion of Heroism 2 Potion of Resistance 2 Potion of Clairvoyance 3 Potion of Diminution 3 Potion of Gaseous Form 3 COVEN You can induct others into your insidious coven. By performing a special ritual over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can intermingle your cursed magic with a willing creature which has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature. This creature enters into your coven. You can have up to two creatures other than yourself in your coven at one time. While two or more members of your coven are within 30 feet of one another, they gain the ability to cast additional spells, as shown on the Coven Spellcasting table. Additionally, members of your coven gain access to a shared pool of 5 spell slots\u2014 one of each level, from 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> level\u2014which they can use to cast any spell known to them. Expended spell slots are regained when all members of the coven finish a long rest. Coven members use their own spellcasting ability to determine spell attack bonuses and spell save DCs. A coven member can\u2019t cast spells of a level for which they do not have personal spell slots, even if using a higher level shared spell slot. A shared spell slot can be used, for instance, to cast a lower level spell at higher levels, but it can\u2019t be used to cast a spell normally too high-level for a spellcaster. Coven Spellcasting Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> bane, hideous laughter 2<sup>nd</sup> invisibility, ray of enfeeblement 3<sup>rd</sup> bestow curse, counterspell 4<sup>th</sup> banishment, polymorph 5<sup>th</sup> contagion, scrying DUAL HEX When you cast a hex which targets one creature, you can target two creatures instead. While both targets are under the effect of your hex, you gain the benefits of your Insidious Spell feature against each of them. FORCEFUL PERSONALITY Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. HYBRID As a bonus action, if your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you can meld with it, transforming into a magical hybrid. For the next minute, you gain the following benefits: \u2022 You gain temporary hit points equal to your familiar\u2019s hit points. \u2022 Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as you are not holding a shield. \u2022 You gain two natural melee weapons, corresponding to your familiar\u2019s attacks. You have proficiency with these weapons, and use Charisma for the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, these natural weapons deal 1d10 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice). \u2022 You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore his benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks. \u2022 You can use any action or movement your familiar possesses. This transformation lasts one minute or until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When it ends, your familiar is dismissed, and you can\u2019t summon it again until you finish a short or long rest. POISON APPLE As an action, you can produce a magical apple out of thin air. This apple can possess whatever appearance you wish, be that a ruby red coloration, a golden skin, or the appearance of crystal. On your turn, you can use your action to eat the apple, granting you the following benefits: \u2022 You regain hit points equal to twice your witch level, plus your Charisma modifier. \u2022 You regain an expended spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or lower. \u2022 You can end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. However, the apple is suffused with your insidious magic. If a creature other than yourself eats the apple, it does not gain any benefits and instead must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for up to 24 hours. For each hour the creature is poisoned, it loses 4d8 hit points. This loss can\u2019t be reduced or avoided. If this reduction causes the creature to drop to 0 hit points, the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and falls into a catatonic sleep, remaining unconscious for up to 7 days. A remove curse spell or similar magic can awaken this creature early. The apple shrivels and become nonmagical if it isn\u2019t eaten in 24 hours. Once you produce a magic apple, you can\u2019t produce another one until you finish a long rest. POSSESSION As an action, your body becomes immaterial, and your spirit dives into a Large or smaller creature you can see within 10 feet of you in an attempt to possess it. This target must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature with a challenge rating greater than your witch level automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, you disappear and the target becomes incapacitated and possessed; you gain control of its body but don\u2019t deprive the target of its awareness. While possessing the creature, you can\u2019t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. You maintain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores and your alignment, but otherwise use the creature\u2019s statistics. You don\u2019t gain access to the target\u2019s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. For the purposes of spells and effects which can end possession, such as the spell dispel evil and good, you are treated as an undead spirit and can be banished from the target, returning to your own body, which rematerializes within 5 feet of the target. This possession lasts for 1 hour, or until the body drops to 0 hit points or you are forced out by a spell or other magical effect that ends possession. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest. WAR HEX When you cast a hex that targets a single creature, you can use your bonus action to cast a cantrip targeting the same creature. WITCH'S BROOM You can use your action to enchant a mundane object\u2014like a broom, cauldron, or rug\u2014to fly for you. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet while holding this item with one hand, as long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield. You can only enchant one object using this ability at a time. If you target another object using this effect, the enchantment on the previous object ends. WITCH'S HUT You can perform a 24-hour long ritual to enchant a structure which can fit within a 15-foot cube, animating it as a Huge object, as per the animate objects spell. The structure rises up on a pair of magical legs and follows your commands. The entrance to the structure is linked to an extradimensional abode, as per the magnificent mansion spell. You can command the structure from inside this abode. If the structure is destroyed, the extradimensional abode is unharmed, but its occupants are ejected to unoccupied spaces adjacent to the structure. As an action, you can teleport the structure to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. Once you teleport the structure, you can\u2019t do it again until you finish a long rest. You can repeat the 24-hour ritual to end the enchantment on your previous structure and enchant a new one. WITCH'S CRAFTS NAME DESCRIPTION Black Magic Practices the necromantic arts uses dark spells of suffering Blood Magic Lays terrible curses and draws power from blood sacrifices Green Magic Practices magic associated with plants, animals, the living world Purple Magic Wields illusions and enchantments in equal measure Red Magic A destructive spellcaster wielding magic that ruins and burns Steel Magic Melds swordsmanship with wicked hexes Tea Magic A peaceful witch that practices tea ceremonies and divination Technicolor Magic Makes friends with just about everyone they meet White Magic A natural healer and practitioner of restorative magic WITCH\u2019S CRAFTS A witch\u2019s craft is distinct from a school of magic. Whereas magical schools seek to categorize spells, crafts are defined by the use of magic, and seek to capture the essence of spells. There are dozens of varieties, from those practiced by covens in secret, to those plied in marketplace potion shops. Each craft has a number of Craft Spells. New spells are marked with an asterisk. Black Magic Black magic is associated with hexes that cause pain and suffering, and spells which give rise to undeath. Harnessing such a craft can lend you great power, but inevitably carries a cost. Darkness cannot be contained, after all; it merely seeps forth from wherever it is kept. Black Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> exhume*, inflict wounds 2<sup>nd</sup> gentle repose, magic weapon 3<sup>rd</sup> animate dead, vampiric touch 4<sup>th</sup> blight, death ward 5<sup>th</sup> cloudkill, contagion HEX:DECAY When you adopt this craft at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you learn to drain the vitality from a living being. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the beginning of its next turn and its hit point maximum is reduced by the amount of necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the hex ends. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This hex ends at the end of your next turn. UNDEATH COMMAND Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you have intertwined the magic of your familiar with the magic you use to animate the dead. When you use your bonus action to command your familiar, you can use the same bonus action to issue a command to any undead you control via the animate dead spell or similar magic. LIFE TETHER At 10<sup>th</sup> level, as a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see, you can transfer some of that damage to a creature which is the sole target of your hex. You take half the damage (rounded down) and the hexed creature takes the remaining damage. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. BLACK SACRIFICE Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, if your familiar is within 10 feet of you, you can use your action to command it to dissolve its magical bond to this plane, which unleashes a torrent of necromantic energy. Each creature you choose within 20 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 8d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one, and its hit point maximum is reduced by the amount of necrotic damage taken. A target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t summon your familiar again until you finish a long rest. Blood Magic Forbidden by most witch covens, blood magic centers on the use of dark spells and mortal hexes that draw from the spellcaster\u2019s very essence. It is fundamentally more perilous than other witch crafts, but its many risks come with copious rewards. Blood Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> hellish rebuke, hollowing curse* 2<sup>nd</sup> acid arrow, hold person 3<sup>rd</sup> ruby-eye curse*, vampiric touch 4<sup>th</sup> blight, dominate beast 5<sup>th</sup> cloudkill, dominate person HEX:BLOOD CURSE Starting when you choose this craft at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can mark a creature with a sinister blood curse. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, this creature is on the brink of death until the end of your next turn. If the creature at any point in this duration has less than its maximum hit points and has fewer hit points than twice your witch level, it immediately drops to 0 hit points. NOVICE HEMOMANCY Also at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, when you cast a spell which requires material components that do not have a specific cost, you can replace the material components with a drop of blood. ARCANE BLOODLETTING Lastly at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can impel your magic with a measure of your own blood. When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to lose 5 hit points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. DEATHSEEKER At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can see those near death shrouded in a crimson aura. Even in heavily obscured conditions, you can detect the location of creatures within 60 feet that have less than their maximum hit points. This sense can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks you make to track a creature you or your familiar has damaged. HEMOMANTIC RECOVERY Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can perform a blood ritual to bolster your magic. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can spend hit dice to recover expended spell slots. The cost for each spell slot is given on the table below. You can\u2019t use this ability to recover spell slots of 6<sup>th</sup> level or higher. Spell Level Hit Dice 1<sup>st</sup> 2 2<sup>nd</sup> 3 3<sup>rd</sup> 5 4<sup>th</sup> 6 5<sup>th</sup> 7 SANGUINE By 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can wield your own blood like a vicious lash. Once per round, when you cast a spell which deals damage to a creature that is under the effect of your hex, you can choose to lose hit points to increase the amount of damage dealt. For every 5 hit points you lose you can add 2d8 necrotic damage to the damage roll, up to a maximum of 6d8 damage. This feature only applies to a hostile creature which is the sole target of your hex. Green Magic Plants, nature, and things that grow are the domain of green magic. Normally a type of arcana championed by druids, some witches have a close tie to the powers of green magic, and can coax plants and animals into their bidding. Green Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> entangle, goodberry 2<sup>nd</sup> barkskin, beast sense 3<sup>rd</sup> conjure animals, plant growth 4<sup>th</sup> conjure woodland beings, stoneskin 5<sup>th</sup> awaken, tree stride HEX:ELDER TONGUE Starting when you choose this craft at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you know the speech of the forest. As a bonus action, you can attune yourself to the forest, granting you the ability to speak with beasts and plants in a limited manner until the end of your next turn. Most beasts and plants lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but could relay what they have seen or heard in the recent past. While you can speak with them, you have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence beasts and plants. PRIMAL ALLY Also at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, whenever you summon your familiar, you conjure one that is hardier than normal. Add three times your witch level, instead of twice your witch level, to your familiar\u2019s maximum hit points. TWIN FAMILIAR By 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you summon your familiar, you can divide its spirit into two bodies. When summoned this way, your familiar is two identical creatures which share a single pool of hit points. Your twin familiars roll only once for initiative and act on subsequent turns. You can use your bonus action to command one twin to attack and your action to command the other to attack. A spell or feature which targets or dismisses your familiar affects both twins. VITAL NOURISHMENT By 10<sup>th</sup> level, you exude an aura of Green Magic that restores and reinvigorates life around you. When you finish a long rest, plant life within 100 feet of where you finished your long rest grows as if a month had passed with abundant food, water, and other necessities. If the plants would produce fruits, berries, or vegetables, the plants grow enough food to feed six creatures for one day. Additionally, choose up to six creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your witch level + your Charisma modifier. You can also end one disease affecting each creature, or end one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. SACRIFICIAL FAMILIAR At 14<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you are targeted by a melee attack while your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to command it to dive in the way of the attack. This attack targets the familiar instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Purple Magic Purple magic holds sway over the domains of illusions and enchantments that take hold over people\u2019s minds, and anything that is not quite as it seems. Practitioners of this form of magic are puppet masters, shaping the apparent reality of those around them to their advantage. Purple Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> charm person, silent image 2<sup>nd</sup> enthrall, invisibility 3<sup>rd</sup> hypnotic pattern, major image 4<sup>th</sup> confusion, private sanctum 5<sup>th</sup> modify memory, seeming HEX:HALLUCINATION Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can infect the minds of other creatures. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that is immune to being charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw. On a failed save, the target\u2019s perspective of the world distorts into a horrific and alien place. The creature has a \u22121 penalty on all attack rolls and ability checks it makes. Whenever the creature begins its turn, the penalty on all attack rolls and ability checks increases by 1, up to a maximum penalty of \u22125. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. FALSE AUTHORITY By 6<sup>th</sup> level, as an action, you can wrap yourself in an illusory air of expectation. Any creature which sees you perceives you as a figure of authority. A blacksmith might see you as a guild master, whereas a soldier might see you as a captain. The changes perceived by a viewer fail to hold up to physical inspection. This illusion lasts for 1 hour or until you end it on your turn (no action required). To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. DECEITFUL TRANSPOSITION Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your bonus action to create an illusory disguise over two creatures within 60 feet of you, making it seem as if they have teleported and switched places. The disguise makes it seem that the creatures are in one another\u2019s spaces, moving all sounds, smells, and other effects caused by each creature to their correct points of origin. Creatures under the effect of the disguise do not perceive any part of the illusion. A creature can use its action to examine a magically disguised creature and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can see both illusory creatures for what they are. This illusion lasts for 1 minute, and ends early when one of the illusory creatures takes damage, or if one of the creatures performs any physical interaction which reveals itself to be an illusion. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. WAKING NIGHTMARE By 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can warp everything a creature sees into a hellscape, full of terrible creatures that wish them harm. When a creature fails its saving throw against your Hallucination hex, you can further distort its mind, causing it to lose the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it sees as enemies until the hex ends. Whenever the hexed creature chooses a target for an attack, spell, or other ability, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range. The hexed creature must always use its reaction to make an opportunity attack, if a creature provokes one. This effect ends after 1 minute. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. Red Magic Arcane magic tied to channeling the elements is deemed red magic, and is extremely hazardous when used. Witches that specialize in red magic are among the deadliest spellcasters in existence, channeling their curse into unhindered arcane wrath. Red Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> burning hands, magic missile 2<sup>nd</sup> acid arrow, scorching ray 3<sup>rd</sup> fireball, protection from energy 4<sup>th</sup> ice storm, wall of fire 5<sup>th</sup> cone of cold, telekinesis HEX:IMPERIL Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you know how to strip away your foes\u2019 magical defenses. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw, and choose any one damage type. On a failed save, the creature loses resistance to the given damage type until the end of your next turn, or is treated as having only resistance, if it is immune. CONVOLUTE ENERGY At 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn. INVULNERABILITY Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to briefly become invulnerable. Subtract 50 from the damage dealt, to a minimum of 0. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. ELEMENTAL ANNIHILATION Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a witch spell which deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can expend another spell slot of equal or higher level to maximize the damage dealt. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. Steel Magic Secret covens throughout the Material Plane practice their magic by drawing spells into their blades. Maniacally cackling and whirling their way across the battlefield, these witches weave their curses into a bloody tapestry whenever they bring their steel to bear. Steel Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> heroism, shield 2<sup>nd</sup> heat metal, magic weapon 3<sup>rd</sup> blink, haste 4<sup>th</sup> death ward, freedom of movement 5<sup>th</sup> flame strike, telekinesis BONUS PROFICIENCIES Beginning when you choose this craft at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you gain proficiency with battleaxes, flails, longswords, morningstars, rapiers, scimitars, tridents, and warhammers. HEX:MALEVOLENCE Also at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you have learned a secret hex associated with the profane rites of long-forgotten covens. You can use your bonus action to shroud yourself with an evil smog until the end of your next turn. You don't need to make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on this hex. You gain the following benefits: \u2022 Your Armor Class equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as you are not holding a shield. \u2022 When you make an attack with a melee weapon that lacks the Heavy property, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for its attack and damage rolls. \u2022 Whenever you take damage from a creature which you can see that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. CACKLING KILLER At 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you use your Cackle feature, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. SOULSWORD FAMILIAR Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, as a bonus action, you can draw the essence of your familiar into your weapon, manifesting in a cloak of green flame. Your familiar is dismissed, and can\u2019t be resummoned until you finish a short or long rest. Until your familiar is resummoned, this weapon deals an additional 1d8 fire damage on a hit. SHRIEKING STRIKE Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, your accursed magic has seeped into your weapon. Once per turn, when you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can perform a shrieking strike. The target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Tea Magic Tea witches are among the calmest and friendliest of witches, radiating warmth and contentment despite their hideous faces and hollow souls. At their very worst, they can be cranky (if forced to drink their tea in a hurry), or twitchy (after too much tea), but even then, they are likely to look for peaceful solutions to their problems. Tea Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> hideous laughter, sanctuary 2<sup>nd</sup> augury, calm emotions 3<sup>rd</sup> clairvoyance, sending 4<sup>th</sup> divination, private sanctum 5<sup>th</sup> legend lore, scrying HEX:TASSEOGRAPHY Starting when you choose this craft at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can see glimpses of the future in your tea leaves. As an action, choose a friendly creature you can see within 60 feet, roll a d20, and record the number rolled. Until the end of your next turn, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by the creature with this foretelling roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. Once you replace a roll in this way, this hex ends. TEA CEREMONY Also at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can magically conjure enough tea for you and your allies whenever you take a short or long rest. A creature who drinks this tea loses one additional level of exhaustion during that rest period. SHAPES AND OMENS By 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can see deeper glimpses into the future through your tea leaves. When you finish a long rest, you can examine the shape of your tea leaves. The GM tells you a shape which hints at future events. For example, if you see a tower in your tea leaves, you might encounter a wizard on the following day. If you see a serpent, you might encounter a liar or a monster. HERBAL REMEDY At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can cast the spell greater restoration without expending a spell slot or material components. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again. INVIGORATE By 14<sup>th</sup> level, as a bonus action, you can give yourself or a friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of you a temporary rush of energy by drinking an energizing cup of tea. On the target\u2019s next turn, the target can take one additional action on top of its regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before using it again. Technicolor Magic Technicolor Magic witches draw their power from the friendships they find around them. They have a penchant for collecting adorable animals of all shapes and sizes, which they will never endanger, no matter how dire the situation. Above all, Technicolor witches are defined by their relentlessly positive outlook, which empowers their arcana and spurs on their allies. Technicolor Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> color spray, speak with animals 2<sup>nd</sup> animal messenger, enhance ability 3<sup>rd</sup> fly, speak with plants 4<sup>th</sup> freedom of movement, locate creature 5<sup>th</sup> animate objects, telepathic bond ANIMAL FRIENDS Starting when you choose this craft at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks you make to befriend beasts. You can use your Charisma, instead of Wisdom, on these checks if the creature is Small or smaller. If you adopt a beast as a pet, you can temporarily dismiss it into an extradimensional space, as you would a familiar. HEX:MUSICAL INTERLUDE At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you gain a hex which inspires your allies with an uplifting speech or an encouraging musical number. As an action, you can grant each willing creature you can see which can see you within 30 feet a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier plus half your witch level. These temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn. FRIENDSHIP BRACELET Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, as an action, you can weave a small bracelet of string, beads, or some other inexpensive material. You can always determine the location of a creature wearing one of these bracelets, as long as you and it are on the same plane of existence. You can target the creature with spells and effects as if you could see it, even if an obstacle or environmental effect obscures the target from your view. POSITIVITY Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can leverage your bonds of friendship for protection. As an reaction, when a creature you can see attacks you, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of friendly creatures within 5 feet of you. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. REDEMPTIVE ARC Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can redeem your foes, instead of slaying them. When a hostile creature you can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to protect the creature from harm, causing it to fall unconscious. When the creature awakens, it is freed of any magical effect which would charm, curse, frighten, or possess it. Furthermore, the creature loses one of its Bonds or Flaws which inspired it to be hostile towards you. Once you use this ability, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. White Magic White magic is fundamentally good and benevolent for all living things. Witches that adopt this craft, in spite of the hateful curse that infects them, often dedicate themselves to healing and caretaking, with the intent of bettering the world. White Magic Bonus Spells Spell Level Spells 1<sup>st</sup> bless, cure wounds 2<sup>nd</sup> lesser restoration, prayer of healing 3<sup>rd</sup> beacon of hope, revivify 4<sup>th</sup> death ward, guardian of faith 5<sup>th</sup> mass cure wounds, raise dead HEX:REMEDY At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you learn a hex which closes wounds and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch level. A creature which regains hit points from this hex can\u2019t be affected by it again until it finishes a short or long rest. TALISMAN OF PROTECTION At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can craft a talisman which wards off harm. Creating a talisman takes one hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short rest. You can only have one of these talismans at a time; crafting a new talisman causes the previous talisman to become mundane. Any creature that wears a talisman can add a d4 to all saving throws it makes. BENEVOLENT SURGE At 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you, your familiar, or one of your allies you can see within 30 feet takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Charisma modifier. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again. WITCH'S GIFT Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell or hex which restores a creature\u2019s hit points, that creature gains a +3 bonus to its Armor Class until the end of your next turn.</p>"},{"location":"DnD%20Demo/DnD%20Demo/","title":"Voyage to Stormwreck Isle","text":"Set the SceneExplaining the GameRun the Encounter <p>Read this text to set the scene:</p> <p>Your journey has been smooth sailing so far.

Squail brothers have an understanding they would die to protect one another, and take this agreement only if one is truly worthy, considering it the highest form of respect.
