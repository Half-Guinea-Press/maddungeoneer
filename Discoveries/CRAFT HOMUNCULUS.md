# CRAFT HOMUNCULUS

Using a special alchemical process requiring 8 hours of work, which can be performed over the course of a long rest, you can create a homunculus. A homunculus functions as a familiar summoned by the find familiar spell, with several differences:
- The telepathic link between you and your homunculus functions at any distance, provided you and your homunculus are on the same plane of existence.
- You cannot dismiss your homunculus as you would a familiar.
- Your homunculus is a construct and cannot assume a different form.
- Your homunculus can take the Attack action on its turn.

When your homunculus dies, its body remains, and can be reanimated in a procedure requiring 1 hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short or long rest.
