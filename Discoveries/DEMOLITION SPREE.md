# DEMOLITION SPREE

Prerequisite: 13th level, Mad Bomber Field of Study

When you take the Use an Object action to prime and throw a bomb, you can throw a number of bombs equal to the number of the bomb’s damage dice, instead of only one. Each bomb you throw deals 1d10 damage plus your Intelligence modifier and can’t target the same creature or space. You must spend reagent dice separately on these bombs and can apply a bomb formula to only one of them.
