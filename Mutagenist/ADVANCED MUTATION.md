# ADVANCED MUTATION

Starting at 10th level, whenever you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose one of the following additional mutations:

## Hyperelastic.

Your flesh takes on a rubbery quality, allowing you to bend and stretch with ease. Your melee weapon attacks gain the Reach property, if they did not already have them. Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks you make to escape grapple or slip binds.

## Mucilaginous.

Your skin secretes a thick, extremely sticky substance which helps you adhere to objects. You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on ability checks made to escape grapple with you. Polybrachia. You grow a pair of additional arms. These arms are fully functional and can be used to hold weapons and shields (allowing you to hold 2 two-handed weapons, or 4 one-handed weapons), perform somatic components of spells, and perform other actions, though the arms themselves donâ€™t grant you any additional actions.
