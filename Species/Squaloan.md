# Squaloan

“Aye, I can take you 'cross the water, but its gonna cost ya'.” stated the older dwarf, his thick grayed beard drenched in whatever foul smelling ale he was drinking. “See those are squal waters. Normally fine folk, if you follow their rules. But step out a'line, or - gods forbid! - bring a merfolk, and you're shark meat friend.” “Don’t give them a bad name. They’ve saved many ships” protested the younger elven man sitting next to him. “And sunk just as many! Now, do ya' want my ship or not?”

Tall, frightening, and tailless shark-like creatures with a wicked smile, squaloans often terrify would be sailors from ever crossing the seas. From lone hunters, to groups sized in the small hundreds, squaloan call the seas home. Very little ties an individual squaloan to another, but most form families in parts of the ocean rich with life, like coral reefs. While separate, and often very different in culture, two things binds them together: An extreme distrust of merfolk and fey, and an innate brutish nature that often leads to conflict.

## Mercencaries of the sea

Squaloans tread on the borders between civility and tribalism at all times. Each clan finds its own way of life, but most tend to lead to a similar path. Due to their immense strength and knowledge of the seas, it's extremely common for sailors to hire local clans of squaloan to guide ships. As long as the sailors pay what they are due, there's rarely issue, but due to a few greedy sailors many have heard of the ferocity of a hostile squoloan.

This coupled with the more territorial and hostile tribes gives squaloan a bad reputation among many, and has lead to several cities hunting them to near extinction.

## Friends for life

Squaloans dont often make friends outside their tribe, often finding bond in what is called in their tribe a “Squail Brother”. This is a permanent bond between two squaloan as hunting family, and while similar to marriage of other races, this does not necessarily entail a romantic relationship. Squail brothers have an understanding they would die to protect one another, and take this agreement only if one is truly worthy, considering it the highest form of respect. It is unusual but not unheard of for races outside squaloan to become one's Squail brother, but is never mocked or looked down on. To a squaloan, if one is worthy of being called a squail brother, then they are worthy of respect.

## Squaloan Names

Squaloan are not given names at birth, instead they usually decide what it is when they finish their first hunt, but this changes tribe to tribe. The only thing that doesn't change is the first hunt: it's always a fey, a sahuagin, or merrow. The chosen name often focuses on a specific element of that hunt, like a wound inflicted or received, a feeling, or an element of the environment. Squaloan have recently begun to take on human names as more and more interact with other species.

Tribe Names take on the location they inhabit.
- Common Classic Squaloan Names: Lost Blood, Blue Scales, Festered Wound, Murky, Night
- Tribe Names: Of Lost Seas, Beneath Coral Shelves, Beside rocky shores, Of the depths unseen
