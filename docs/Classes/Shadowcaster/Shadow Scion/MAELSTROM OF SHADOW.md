# MAELSTROM OF SHADOW

Starting at 14th level, you can draw forth a temporary funnel cloud of shadow-stuff. As an action, choose one 5-foot square within 60 feet that you can see. A column of swirling cloud and darkness descends from the sky (or ceiling) to touch the ground in that space and lasts until the end of your next turn. A creature in the column when it appears, or who enters the column for the first time during a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is restrained.

The area is heavily obscured. A creature restrained by the column can’t sense or affect the world outside the column, and nothing outside the column can affect the creature. It sees only swirling darkness, hears only the roar of winds on the Plane of Shadow.

At the end of your next turn, just before the funnel vanishes, the creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and 5d10 damage of one other type of your choice: either cold, lightning, or thunder.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
