# FLESH OF SHADOW

Starting at 10th level, as an action, you can transform into a shadow elemental. You revert to your normal form after a number of hours equal to half your shadowcaster level, when you spend a bonus action to do so, if you drop to 0 hit points, if you fall unconscious, or if you die. Your game statistics are replaced by those of the elemental, except as follows. You retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the shadow elemental. If the elemental has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the elemental’s bonus instead of yours.

When you transform, you assume the elemental’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

While transformed, you cannot cast spells, though transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell you’ve already cast. You can speak, but only in a whisper, and must be within 10 feet of another creature for it to hear you.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the elemental is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses unless the elemental also has that sense.

You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with your elemental form has no effect until you leave the form.

Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
