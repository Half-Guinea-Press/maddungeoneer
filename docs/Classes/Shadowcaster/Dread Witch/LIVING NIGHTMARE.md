# LIVING NIGHTMARE

Starting at 14th level, you can tap into a creature’s subconscious fears. As an action, choose a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that isn’t a construct or undead within 60 feet of you. If the creature requires sleep, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failed save, you have gained access to its subconscious mind, though it is not aware of that fact.

If the target falls asleep at any point within the next 24 hours, so long as it remains on either the same plane as you or on the Plane of Shadow, you instantly become aware of that fact and can enter a trance as if you cast the dream spell on the target. You must choose the monstrous version of the spell, and you are the messenger. When the target awakens, you are aware it has done so and can choose to immediately teleport to a space within 15 feet of the target that it can see. The target is automatically surprised.

Once you use Living Nightmare, you can’t do so again until after a long rest.
