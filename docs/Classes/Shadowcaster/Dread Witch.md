# Dread Witch

The so-called Dread Witch approaches shadow magic through the lens of the sentient mind. The darkness within—fear, primarily, but also despair and other “negative” emotions as well—form a conduit to the darkness beyond that of the rational world. By learning to manipulate terror, both their own and others’, the Dread Witch learns to tap into greater and more tangible magics as well.

## DREAD PRESENCE

At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. In addition, as an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. Creatures that fail their saving throws are frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## FEAR-WIELDER

At 6th level, whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead of your normal proficiency bonus. In addition, when you are subject to an effect meant to cause you to become frightened—even if you successfully save or are immune to fear—you can choose to gain a special form of inspiration that you must spend before the end of your next turn. You can gain this even if you already have inspiration. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## DREAD MASTER

Beginning at 10th level, you gain resistance to psychic damage. In addition, you are immune to fear, and when another creature targets you with an effect that causes the frightened condition, you can use your reaction to turn the fear back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

## LIVING NIGHTMARE

Starting at 14th level, you can tap into a creature’s subconscious fears. As an action, choose a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that isn’t a construct or undead within 60 feet of you. If the creature requires sleep, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failed save, you have gained access to its subconscious mind, though it is not aware of that fact.

If the target falls asleep at any point within the next 24 hours, so long as it remains on either the same plane as you or on the Plane of Shadow, you instantly become aware of that fact and can enter a trance as if you cast the dream spell on the target. You must choose the monstrous version of the spell, and you are the messenger. When the target awakens, you are aware it has done so and can choose to immediately teleport to a space within 15 feet of the target that it can see. The target is automatically surprised.

Once you use Living Nightmare, you can’t do so again until after a long rest.
