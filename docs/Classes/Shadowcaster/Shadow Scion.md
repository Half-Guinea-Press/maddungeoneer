# Shadow Scion

Perhaps the most straightforward of the Umbral Ways, the Shadow Scion studies the movement of the Plane of Shadow and the dark energies that permeate it, through its interactions and overlap with the Material Plane. By manipulating planar boundaries they can not only weave magic of shadows, but use the environment of the Plane of Shadow to alter portions of the physical world.

## WARDING SHADE

At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, the shadows of the environment lash out on your behalf. You can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## CHILD OF TWO WORLDS

As of 6th level, you no longer suffer exhaustion from extremes of heat or cold, nor do you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to wind or rain. Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can choose to infuse yourself with the essence of the Plane of Shadow. You gain resistance to cold damage and necrotic damage, but vulnerability to radiant damage, until you finish a long rest.

## FLESH OF SHADOW

Starting at 10th level, as an action, you can transform into a shadow elemental. You revert to your normal form after a number of hours equal to half your shadowcaster level, when you spend a bonus action to do so, if you drop to 0 hit points, if you fall unconscious, or if you die. Your game statistics are replaced by those of the elemental, except as follows. You retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the shadow elemental. If the elemental has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the elemental’s bonus instead of yours.

When you transform, you assume the elemental’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

While transformed, you cannot cast spells, though transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell you’ve already cast. You can speak, but only in a whisper, and must be within 10 feet of another creature for it to hear you.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the elemental is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses unless the elemental also has that sense.

You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with your elemental form has no effect until you leave the form.

Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

## MAELSTROM OF SHADOW

Starting at 14th level, you can draw forth a temporary funnel cloud of shadow-stuff. As an action, choose one 5-foot square within 60 feet that you can see. A column of swirling cloud and darkness descends from the sky (or ceiling) to touch the ground in that space and lasts until the end of your next turn. A creature in the column when it appears, or who enters the column for the first time during a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is restrained.

The area is heavily obscured. A creature restrained by the column can’t sense or affect the world outside the column, and nothing outside the column can affect the creature. It sees only swirling darkness, hears only the roar of winds on the Plane of Shadow.

At the end of your next turn, just before the funnel vanishes, the creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and 5d10 damage of one other type of your choice: either cold, lightning, or thunder.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
