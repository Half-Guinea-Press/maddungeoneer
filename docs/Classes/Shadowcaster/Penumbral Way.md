# Penumbral Way

All shadowcasters draw on the magics of darkness, the void, and the Plane of Shadow, but each must choose a particular method or school of doing so. These include the way of the [Dread Witch](Penumbral%20Ways/Dread%20Witch.md), the way of the [Noctimancer](Penumbral%20Ways/Noctimancer.md), and the way of the [Shadow Scion](Penumbral%20Ways/Shadow%20Scion.md. Your choice of Penumbral Way grants you features at 1st level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

All shadowcasters are a bit odd, even compared to other spellcasters. The effort to understand the metaphysical meaning and powers of darkness, of the Plane of Shadow’s influence on the real world, is stressful to even the strongest minds, requiring mastery of formulae and arcane theories that fly in the face of sanity. Thus, in order to avoid shattering their minds, all shadowcasters approach their art through one specific aspect of darkness, one particular area where—be it factually or thematically—the Plane of Shadow overlaps reality. This combination of approach and framework of study is called a Penumbral Way. Three of the most common focus on fear as a representation of inner darkness; on the intertwining of shadow’s influence on magic itself; and on the literal connection between planes, where the Plane of Shadow actually affects the environment of the Material Plane.
