# Shadow Elemental

The incarnated life forces of earth, air, fire, and water that exist on the elemental planes, that become traditional elementals when summoned to the Material World, have their own dark reflections on the Plane of Shadows. Initially mindless echoes, literal shadows, they eventually developed rudimentary awareness of their own. These have become so-called shadow elementals, entities of living shade, formed from the stuff of the Plane of Shadow. Nebulous Form. Unlike true elementals, shadow elementals maintain a semi-physical form at all times, even when unsummoned and freely roaming the Plane of Shadow. This form is constantly shifting, ranging from a blot of darkness all but invisible in the gloom of their home realm, to looming, almost-but-not-quite humanoid silhouettes. Even in the brightest illumination, which shadow elementals find deeply unpleasant, their boundaries are inky and indistinct, like a haze or a dark watercolor painting.

Loathing of Light and Life. Both the gleam of excess light and the warmth of living beings bring shadow elementals pain, and thus they lash out and seek to destroy the source of their discomfort. Like true elementals, they resent being summoned and forced into servitude, but they possess a hostility beyond even the capricious and often destructive instincts of more natural spirits. This doesn’t make them more difficult to control, but shadow elementals do tend toward more of what mortal beings would consider evil behaviors when free to act as they please.

Alone in the Dark. Shadow elementals are solitary entities. They aren’t hostile toward one another, but neither do they seek to congregate; if two or more find themselves in the same vicinity, they tend to simply ignore one another. While they show some understanding of all the various elemental languages, as well as the commands of any who summon them regardless of language, they appear to have no tongue of their own. If they are capable of speech or communication at all, no one has ever observed it. Elemental Nature. A shadow elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
