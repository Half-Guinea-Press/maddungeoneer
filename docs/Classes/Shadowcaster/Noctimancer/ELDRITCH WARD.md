# ELDRITCH WARD

At 6th level, whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Also, when you are targeted by a spell that either requires an attack roll or forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll or to gain advantage on the saving throw. (If a spell involves both an attack roll and a saving throw, you impose disadvantage on the attack roll but gain no benefit on the save.) One you use this ability, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
