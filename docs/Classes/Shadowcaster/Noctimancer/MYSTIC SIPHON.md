# MYSTIC SIPHON

Starting at 14th level, when you successfully use counterspell, dispel magic, or similar magics to negate an existing spell of 1st level or higher cast by another creature, you can capture a shred of the magic you just unwove and bend it to your own purpose. Choose one of the following effects.
- If the spell level is 4th level or higher, regain a spent shadowcaster spell slot. This spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and then fades away if unused.
- Cure one disease afflicting you.
- Remove one level of exhaustion afflicting you.
- End one of the following conditions afflicting you: blinded, deafened, restrained (if caused by magic), or poisoned.
- Make an immediate saving throw against one ongoing effect or condition afflicting you that is ended by a saving throw. If the effect is one that gets worse on a failed save, this extra saving throw does not worsen the effect if it fails.
- Gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw made within 1 minute. You canâ€™t choose this option again until you expend the advantage it grants.
- Regain 1d6 hit points per level of the spell you countered or dispelled.
