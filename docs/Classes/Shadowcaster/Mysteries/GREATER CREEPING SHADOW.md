# GREATER CREEPING SHADOW

Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Intermediate-level Paths

You learn one additional shadowcaster cantrip and one 1st-level shadowcaster spell, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known and Spells Known columns of the shadowcaster table.

You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must know three additional qualifying spells each time; you canâ€™t use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once. So, for instance, you could select this mystery a second time once you know spells from six total Intermediate Paths.
