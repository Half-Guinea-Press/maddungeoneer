# CREEPING SHADOW

Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Initiate-level Paths

You learn two additional shadowcaster cantrips, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known column of the shadowcaster table.

You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must know three additional qualifying spells each time; you canâ€™t use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once. So, for instance, you could select this mystery a second time once you know spells from six total Initiate Paths, a third time if you know spells from nine, and so forth.
