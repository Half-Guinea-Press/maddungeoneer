# MASTER OF SUPREME SHADOW MAGIC

Prerequisite: 17th level

Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6th, 7th, 8th, or 9th level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using a 9th-level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

A spell obtained by this Mystery counts as a known spell for purposes of determining whether you’ve completed a Path, and how many Paths you have access to.
