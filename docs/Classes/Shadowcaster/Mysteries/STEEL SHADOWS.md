# STEEL SHADOWS

You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. As a bonus action, you can end the spell immediately to gain advantage on one Dexterity (Stealth) check you make before the end of your turn. Once you end the spell in this way, you canâ€™t use Steel Shadows again until you finish a short or long rest.
