# FUNDAMENTALS OF SHADOW

Choose three shadowcaster cantrips that you know. You no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly material components to cast those cantrips (you can still benefit from using an arcane focus).

In addition, you can choose to cast one of these cantrips as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a spell as a bonus action using this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing three different cantrips each time.
