# GREATER PATH SAVANT

Prerequisite: Path Savant

Choose an Initiate-level or Intermediate-level Spell Path to which you have already applied the Path Savant mystery. You can cast one spell of 5th level or lower from that Path, at your normal shadowcaster spell slot level, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can take this mystery multiple times, applying it to a different qualifying Path each time.
