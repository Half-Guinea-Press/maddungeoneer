# TOUCH OF DARKNESS

You can cast spider climb on yourself without expending a spell slot. In addition, all ability checks made to track you have disadvantage, and you can walk across water and other liquids, but you must end your turn on solid ground or Touch of Darkness ends immediately.

Once you use this mystery, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach 11th level as a shadowcaster, you no longer need to concentrate on spider climb when casting Touch of Darkness.
