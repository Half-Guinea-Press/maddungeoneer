# PATH SAVANT

Prerequisite: At least one complete Spell Path

Choose a Spell Path for which you know all three spells. You no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly material components to cast spells from that Path (You can still benefit from using an arcane focus). In addition, you can choose to cast one of these spells as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a spell as a bonus action using this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing three different cantrips each time.
