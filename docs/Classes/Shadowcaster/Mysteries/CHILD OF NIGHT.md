# CHILD OF NIGHT

You learn the find familiar spell. This spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

Your familiar, regardless of what form it takes, is clearly a creature of shadow. It is unnaturally dark of hue; wisps of darkness trail from its skin and eyes. It gains darkvision 60 feet (if it doesn’t already have it). While the familiar is in dim light or darkness, attacks against the familiar have disadvantage unless the attacker can see the familiar clearly. While the familiar is in bright light, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
