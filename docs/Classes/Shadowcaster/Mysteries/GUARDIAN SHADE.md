# GUARDIAN SHADE

Prerequisite: 3rd level

As an action, you animate your own shadow to fight for you in battle. It materializes in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a shadow, with the following alterations:
- It is an elemental instead of undead.
- It shares your alignment.
- It can’t create new shadows.

You must concentrate to maintain this effect, as though it were a spell. The shadow remains active until you cease concentrating, until it is reduced to zero hit points, or 1 minute, at which point it returns to its normal form. You don’t cast a shadow for the duration. Once you use this mystery, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you manifest two shadows rather than one. This increases to three at 11th level, and four at 17th level.
