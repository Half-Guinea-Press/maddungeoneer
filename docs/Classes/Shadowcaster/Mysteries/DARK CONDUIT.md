# DARK CONDUIT

Prerequisite: 5th level

You have learned to cast spells through the edges of the Plane of Shadow so that their passage through the Material Plane is warped. As a bonus action, choose a target that you could clearly see at any point since the start of your last turn, but that you can no longer see. Before the end of your turn, you can cast a spell that targets only that creature even if the spell requires you to see your target. In addition, the target gains no benefit of being invisible to you, and it gains no protection from cover against this spell. You must be aware of a targetâ€™s presence to use this feature on it.
