# MASTER OF GREATER SHADOW MAGIC

Prerequisite: 13th level

Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6th or 7th level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using a 7th-level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. A spell obtained by this mystery counts as a known spell for purposes of determining whether you’ve completed a Path, and how many Paths you have access to.
