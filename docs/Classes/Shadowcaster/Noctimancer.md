# Noctimancer

All shadowcasters understand that shadow is the truest, most fundamental aspect of reality. Take away light, there is darkness; take away heat, there is cold. Noctimancers, or night mages, focus on the shadow that underlies magic. Through their studies, they learn not only to tap into the power of the Plane of Shadow, but to use the underlying reality to manipulate magic itself.

## NOCTIMANCER EXPANDED SPELL LIST

Their ability to weave shadow into other, more traditional forms of magic allows Noctimancers to select from an expanded list when learning shadowcaster spells. The following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell list for you.

## KNOWLEDGE ARCANE

At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. In addition, you learn to cast comprehend languages and identify as rituals, without requiring material components. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means.

## ELDRITCH WARD

At 6th level, whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Also, when you are targeted by a spell that either requires an attack roll or forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll or to gain advantage on the saving throw. (If a spell involves both an attack roll and a saving throw, you impose disadvantage on the attack roll but gain no benefit on the save.) One you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## ARCANE SECRETS

At 10th level, choose three spells from the wizard spell list that do not also appear on the shadowcaster spell list: one 1st-level spell, one 2nd-level (or lower) spell, and one 3rd-level (or lower) spell. You add these to your spells known, and they are shadowcaster spells for you. At 14th level, add one additional wizard spell that does not appear on your shadowcaster spell list, of 4th level or lower, to your spells known. It is a shadowcaster spell for you.

## MYSTIC SIPHON

Starting at 14th level, when you successfully use counterspell, dispel magic, or similar magics to negate an existing spell of 1st level or higher cast by another creature, you can capture a shred of the magic you just unwove and bend it to your own purpose. Choose one of the following effects.
- If the spell level is 4th level or higher, regain a spent shadowcaster spell slot. This spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and then fades away if unused.
- Cure one disease afflicting you.
- Remove one level of exhaustion afflicting you.
- End one of the following conditions afflicting you: blinded, deafened, restrained (if caused by magic), or poisoned.
- Make an immediate saving throw against one ongoing effect or condition afflicting you that is ended by a saving throw. If the effect is one that gets worse on a failed save, this extra saving throw does not worsen the effect if it fails.
- Gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw made within 1 minute. You can’t choose this option again until you expend the advantage it grants.
- Regain 1d6 hit points per level of the spell you countered or dispelled.
