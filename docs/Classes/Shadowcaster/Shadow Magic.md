# Shadow Magic

Your study of the Plane of Shadow and of darkness, along with your more general arcane research, have granted you the ability to cast a variety of spells, many of which are intrinsically tied to shadow and known to no other casters.

[[Shadowcaster Spell List]]

CANTRIPS

You know three cantrips of your choice from the shadowcaster spell list. You learn additional shadowcaster cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown on the Cantrips Known column of the Shadowcaster table.

SPELL SLOTS

The Shadowcaster table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your shadowcaster spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd- level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell dusk and dawn, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the shadowcaster spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Shadowcaster table shows when you learn more shadowcaster spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new shadowcaster spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shadowcaster spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shadowcaster spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. (Remember, however, that many Mysteries require you to have completed Paths, or to have access to a certain number of Paths, as part of their prerequisite. If you no longer meet these prerequisites due to replacing a spell, you lose access to that Mystery’s benefits.)

SPELL PATHS

In addition to being divided by level, as with other classes, shadowcaster spells are also divided into related groups of three called Paths. Initiate-level Paths include spells of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level; Intermediate-level Paths of 4th, 5th, and 6th level; and Master-level Paths of 7th, 8th, and 9th level. (You learn spells of 6th level and above by taking certain Mysteries, not through your standard shadow magic class feature. Mysteries are magical or supernatural abilities you possess, as described below.) In most ways, these Paths are purely thematic, like spell schools. You are not required to complete a Path once begun, nor are you required to choose spells from a Path in order. When you learn a 5th-level spell, for instance, it need not come from the same Path as any 4th-level spells you know.

Certain Mysteries, however, do require that you have completed a Path in order to take them, while others require that you have access to spells from multiple different Paths. Thus, depending on which Mysteries you wish to take, it may be more advantageous to focus your spells and complete a few Paths; or go for a broad selection of abilities instead. Each has its advantages.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your shadowcaster spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shadowcaster spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your shadowcaster spells.
