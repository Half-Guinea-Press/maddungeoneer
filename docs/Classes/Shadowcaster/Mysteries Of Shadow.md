# Mysteries Of Shadow

As you delve deeper into your investigations of night, of the void, of the Plane of Shadow, you learn scraps and snippets of larger, incomprehensible eldritch truths. These secrets, known as Mysteries of Shadow, grant you additional mystical abilities, powers, or simple understanding. At their highest levels, some even grant you the ability to cast spells of higher level than your shadow magic spell slots would normally permit. At 2nd level, you gain two Mysteries of Shadow of your choice. Your mystery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain shadowcaster levels, you gain additional mysteries of your choice, as shown in the Mysteries Known column of the Shadowcaster table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mysteries you know and replace it with another mystery that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

If a mystery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the mystery at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. If you later cease to meet the prerequisite—perhaps because you’ve traded out a necessary spell or other mystery—you lose all benefits of that mystery until you once again meet the prerequisites. You can only select a given mystery once, unless the mystery description specifies otherwise.
