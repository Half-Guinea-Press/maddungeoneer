Beginning at 5th level, you carry a supply of concussive explosives which help you escape from perilous situations. As a bonus action, you can throw one of these explosives at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you canâ€™t take reactions until the start of its next turn.
