# ALCHEMICAL RESURRECTION

Starting at 18th level, your medicines are potent enough to rouse the dead. By using your action to mix 500 gp worth of diamond dust into a potion of superior healing or a potion of supreme healing, you create a potion of raise dead. Pouring this concoction on a humanoid corpse that has been dead no longer than 10 days as an action causes the effect of the raise dead spell.
