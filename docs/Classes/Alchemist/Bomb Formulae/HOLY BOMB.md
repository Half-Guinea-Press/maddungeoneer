# HOLY BOMB

By adding a few drops of holy water to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a holy bomb. A holy bomb deals radiant damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice, unless the target is a celestial, fiend, or undead. The bomb’s damage dice are d6s against celestials and d12s against fiends and undead.
