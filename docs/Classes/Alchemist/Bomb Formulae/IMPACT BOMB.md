# IMPACT BOMB

By replacing your bombâ€™s explosive contents with a more reactive one, you can change it into an impact bomb. An impact bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is pushed 5 feet away from the center of the blast.
