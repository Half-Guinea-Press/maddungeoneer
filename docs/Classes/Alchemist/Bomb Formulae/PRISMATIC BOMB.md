# PRISMATIC BOMB

By adding an ounce of polyjuice, an unpredictable, multicolored chemical, to your bombâ€™s explosive contents, you can change it into a prismatic bomb. A prismatic bomb deals damage randomly-determined instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a randomly-determined type of saving throw. Roll on each of the following tables.

| 1-2  | Dexterity    |
| 3-4  | Constitution |
| 5-6  | Wisdom       |

| d6   | Damage    |

| 1    | Acid      |
| 2    | Cold      |
