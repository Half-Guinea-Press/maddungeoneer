# TELEPORTATION BOMB

By replacing your bombâ€™s explosive contents with a glowing etherite crystal, you can change it into a teleportation bomb. A teleportation bomb deals no damage and instead opens a rift in space, instantly teleporting you to its point of detonation, if it explodes within 30 feet of you.
