# ARCANO BOMB

Starting at 6th level, you can use craft arcano bombs. By adding an unexpended dynamo to the bomb (and thus expending its spell slot), you can change it into an arcano bomb. An arcano bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage, has d12 damage dice, and deals an additional die of damage, as if a reagent die were added to it.
