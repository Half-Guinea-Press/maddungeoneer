# Philosopher’s Stone

At 20th level, you unlock the crowning achievement of all alchemy: a philosopher’s stone, a dynamo of alchemical energy in a fist-sized glowing jewel. You can construct your philosopher’s stone using your alchemist supplies, 1,000 gp worth of materials, and 7 days of work. You can only have one philosopher’s stone at a time and only you can gain the stone’s benefits. As long as you possess the stone, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended reagent dice.
- You can brew potions as an action, instead of in 10 minutes.
- You age 10 times slower than normal, and your age cannot be magically changed.

Additionally, you learn the following formula, which doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know:

## FORMULA:NUCLEAR BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with your philosopher’s stone, you can change it into a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb deals 10d10 + 100 force damage instead of its normal fire damage, has a blast radius of 1 mile, and completely destroys the philosopher’s stone. Additionally, each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw takes the full bomb damage rolled, or half on a successful save. Creatures within 60 feet can’t avoid this damage with Evasion or other features or spells.
