# Apothecary

Many practically-minded alchemists assume the role of the apothecary, for adventuring parties always needs a healer, and clerics might be in short supply. During their downtime, such alchemists have a marketable skill to depend upon for income and can do an indisputable amount of good with their knowledge. Apothecaries are constantly at work studying potions and herbology, preferring to learn how to mend the body, rather than destroy it.

## BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill.

## FORMULA:PAINKILLER BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create painkiller bombs. By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a slurry of analgesic oil, you can change it into a painkiller bomb. A painkiller bomb deals no damage, and instead grants each creature within its blast radius temporary hit points equal to 1d8 plus half your alchemist level, which last until the end of your next turn. This bomb has no effect on constructs and undead.

## POTION TOSS

Starting at 6th level, you’ve developed a chemical mechanism to deliver potions more effectively to distant allies. You can use your action to hurl a potion at a willing or unconscious creature within 20 feet of you. The target gains the benefit as if they had drank the potion normally.

## SELF-MEDICATION

By 10th level, you’ve tested out your own tolerances to painkillers such that you can take a small measure regularly without ill effect. Whenever you drink a potion that has the effect of restoring your hit points (even if you already have all of your hit points), you gain advantage on saving throws until the end of your next turn.

## ALCHEMICAL RESURRECTION

Starting at 18th level, your medicines are potent enough to rouse the dead. By using your action to mix 500 gp worth of diamond dust into a potion of superior healing or a potion of supreme healing, you create a potion of raise dead. Pouring this concoction on a humanoid corpse that has been dead no longer than 10 days as an action causes the effect of the raise dead spell.
