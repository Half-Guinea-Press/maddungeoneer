# Dynamo Engineer

As an early alchemical thesis states, if the fundamental energy of magic could be captured within physical substance, there would be no need for magic-users. Some alchemists have founded their careers on this notion, inventing and iterating upon small devices known as spell dynamos, which can store and manipulate arcane energy. These dynamos can be configured to store their energy at a specific resonance, such that, when it is released, it perfectly replicates the effect of a spell. Indeed, these few alchemists have begun to brave the frontier of spellcasting without an ounce of arcane talent; just a knack for tinkering and endless inventiveness.

## SPECTRUM ANALYZER

Starting at 2nd level, you have invented a small device shaped like a monocle capable of rendering magical auras visible to the naked eye. You can cast the spell detect magic once without using a spell slot or spell components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

## DYNAMO ENGINEER SPELLCASTING

Also at 2nd level, you’ve learned to cast spells by storing and releasing energy in spell dynamos. Spell Dynamos. You power your spells through handheld arcane devices called spell dynamos, which each hold a single spell slot. The Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Preparing Spells.

Unlike other spells, you must prepare spell dynamos in advance. When you finish a long rest, you configure each of your dynamos to cast a particular wizard spell you know. You can only use a spell dynamo to cast a spell to which it is configured. When you finish a short or long rest, you can reconfigure your unexpended spell dynamos to hold different spells.

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

### Spellcasting Ability.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you cast them using cutting-edge arcane technology. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Use your bomb save DC when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast, and use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with one.

## FORMULA:ARCANO BOMB

Starting at 6th level, you can use craft arcano bombs. By adding an unexpended dynamo to the bomb (and thus expending its spell slot), you can change it into an arcano bomb. An arcano bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage, has d12 damage dice, and deals an additional die of damage, as if a reagent die were added to it.

## COUNTER-DISCHARGE

Beginning at 10th level, when a creature you can see casts a spell which affects you, you can use your reaction to expend a spell dynamo to release a wave of disruptive magical energy. If the spell requires you to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you have advantage on the saving throw. If the spell deals damage, you have resistance against it. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## ARCANE RECYCLER

By 18th level, you can convert otherwise wasted magical energy into a usable form. When you miss with an arcano bomb, you can recycle the spell slot stored in the dynamo and transfer it to one of a number waiting empty dynamos on your person.
