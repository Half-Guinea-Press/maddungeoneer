# Bombs

At 1st level, you can create volatile alchemical bombs using your alchemist’s supplies. Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can create a number of bombs equal to 10 plus twice your alchemist level. For you the cost of materials necessary to create these bombs is negligible. After 24 hours, an unused bomb becomes inert. The statistics of a bomb are shown in the Bomb sidebar above.

Instead of making an attack with a bomb using the Attack action, once per turn you can take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb with explosive reagents and throw it, increasing the bomb’s explosive potential and allowing you to deal additional damage. When you do so, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to the bomb’s damage roll. Additionally, when you throw a bomb in this way, its damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

Saving Throws.

When your bombs call for a saving throw, its save DC is calculated as follows:

Bomb save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## BOMB

Bombs are exotic ranged weapons with the following statistics:

| Name | Cost | Damage    | Weight | Properties                             |
| :--: | :--: | :-------: | :----: | :------------------------------------: |

### SPECIAL PROPERTY: Bomb

When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 5-foot radius and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save or no damage on a successful one.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb’s explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb’s target.

### MISSED BOMBS

As bombs are explosive projectiles, it makes sense to ask what happens if a thrown bomb fails to hit its target. For simplicity, we assume that missed bombs explode harmlessly in the background or fail to detonate altogether, but do not explode in the target’s space and deal damage with its blast radius. The GM can decide which of these two outcomes happens or can determine the outcome randomly.
