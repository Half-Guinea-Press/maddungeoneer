# DYNAMO ENGINEER SPELLCASTING

Also at 2nd level, you’ve learned to cast spells by storing and releasing energy in spell dynamos. Spell Dynamos. You power your spells through handheld arcane devices called spell dynamos, which each hold a single spell slot. The Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Preparing Spells.

Unlike other spells, you must prepare spell dynamos in advance. When you finish a long rest, you configure each of your dynamos to cast a particular wizard spell you know. You can only use a spell dynamo to cast a spell to which it is configured. When you finish a short or long rest, you can reconfigure your unexpended spell dynamos to hold different spells.

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

### Spellcasting Ability.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you cast them using cutting-edge arcane technology. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Use your bomb save DC when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast, and use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with one.
