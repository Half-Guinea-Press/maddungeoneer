# Voyage to Stormwreck Isle

## Set the Scene

??? note "Read this text to set the scene:"
    Your journey has been smooth sailing so far. You left the bustling port of Neverwinter a few days ago, heading for an island with the foreboding name of Stormwreck Isle and a peaceful cloister located there. But you woke this morning to a blood-red sunrise, and dark clouds overhead threaten a violent storm.

??? note "Show the players the illustration of their ship at sea."

    Just as the first lightning flashes across the sky, the ship suddenly lurches to one side as an enormous monster hauls itself up onto the deck.

??? note "Show the playes the illustration of the merrow and adopt a different voice for it (any voice you like, nut try to sound intimidating!) as you read this text:"

    "These waters belong to the Scaled Queen. I'm here to collect her tribute."
