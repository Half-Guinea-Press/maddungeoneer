# Voyage to Stormwreck Isle

## Set the Scene

*Read this text to set the scene:*
    
> Your journey has been smooth sailing so far. You left the bustling port of Neverwinter a few days ago, heading for an island with the foreboding name of Stormwreck Isle and a peaceful cloister located there. But you woke this morning to a blood-red sunrise, and dark clouds overhead threaten a violent storm.

*Show the players the illustration of their ship at sea.*

> Just as the first lightning flashes across the sky, the ship suddenly lurches to one side as an enormous monster hauls itself up onto the deck.

*Show the playes the illustration of the merrow and adopt a different voice for it (any voice you like, but try to sound intimidating!) as you read this text:*

> "These waters belong to the Scaled Queen. I'm here to collect her tribute."

## Explaining the Game

*Read or paraphrase this boxed text:*

> Hi everyone, I'm going to be running you through a quick demo on how to play D&D. I'm the Dungeon Mater, so it's my job to tell you what's happening in the world around you and rolling any dice for the monster. You're playing the heroes!
> I've just told you the situation you're in. What happens next is up to you. You're all trained for combat, so if you want to fight this monster, I can help you do that. But you can also try to negotiate with the monster, or trick it, or anything else you can imagine.
> Just about anything you can think of to try will require some combination of skill, natural ability, and luck to pull off. And the D&D game represents that by having you roll one of these 20-sided dice and add a number from your sheet. So... what do you want to do?
