So I had asked about your character and whether you wanted to change species because you haven't had an opportunity to use it up to now. And I have been thinking about that. What if we make being a Changling a bit more by mixing in some of the abilities of a Plasmoid? We keep the skills and the ability to change what you look like. But to give you some abilities you can use without giving away too much we add Darkvision, the advantage on grapple checks from the Plasmoid's Amorphous ability, Natural Resilience, and the Pseudopod part of the Plasmoid's Shape Self ability. So your species abilities would be these:

Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

Shape Self: As a bonus action, you can extrude a pseudopod that is up to 6 inches wide and 10 feet long or reabsorb it into your body. As part of the same bonus action, you can use this pseudopod to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a Tiny object. The pseudopod contains no sensory organs and can't attack, activate magic items, or lift more than 10 pounds.

You have advantage on ability checks you make to initiate or escape a grapple.

Natural Resilience. You have resistance to acid and poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.

Changeling Instincts. Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.

Shapechanger. As an action, you change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.

You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.

How does that sound? It gives you some cool additional abilities that you can use without being too obvious about it. And it maintains the Changling abilities so when you feel like they would work in the story you can use them.
