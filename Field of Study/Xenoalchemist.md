# Xenoalchemist

A small number of renegade alchemists elect to experiment on themselves, modifying their anatomy or even outright attaching new body parts. These experiments are often considered unethical and dangerous, even by other alchemists, and those that practice them are branded xenoalchemists for their efforts. As xenolchemists progress in their studies, they invariably stumble upon the dangerous practice of alchemical necromancy, which allows them to imbue unlife upon amalgamations of body parts.

## XENOBIOLOGY

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you have advantage on all ability checks you make to identify or research monsters.

## MAD SCIENTIST

By 2nd level, you’ve learned the finer points of reanimating dead appendages and stitching them to things. You gain two monstrous grafts of your choice. Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft. See Appendix C for monstrous grafts.

## SURGICAL ATTACK

Beginning at 6th level, whenever you take the Attack or Use an Object action on your turn, you can make an unarmed strike. You can only use this ability if your unarmed strike is improved by a graft, such as Bestial Features.

## NECROMANTIC ORGANS

By 10th level, you’ve learned how to tinge your own biology with necromancy through reanimated organs that will persist after your death. If you drop to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## IT'S ALIVE!

Beginning at 18th level, your research into the field of necromancy has culminated in an Alchemical Golem stitched together from discarded body parts. You can create an alchemy golem in an 8-hour long procedure, which can be conducted over the course of a long rest. To complete this process, you must have a healer’s kit, alchemist’s supplies, and a knife (or a facility with access to such tools), as well as at least three recently deceased humanoid corpses.

Your alchemy golem acts independently on its own turn, but always obeys your commands. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command your golem if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the golem will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the golem only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the golem continues to follow it until its task is complete. When the alchemy golem drops to 0 hit points, it dies. You can restore your alchemy golem’s hit points and reanimate it over the course of a short or long rest.

You can attach up to three grafts to your alchemy golem. You can only have one alchemy golem at a time.
