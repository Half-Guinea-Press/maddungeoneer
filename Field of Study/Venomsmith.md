# Venomsmith

For every alchemist that has devoted his or her life to healing the sick and infirm, there is another with a darker calling. Commonly called poisoners or venomsmiths, these alchemists are masters in the art of crafting deadly and debilitating poisons. Whether employed by an assassin’s guild or performing assassinations themselves, a venomsmith’s presence is usually accompanied by untimely death.

## VENOMSMITH POISONER

Beginning when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain the [[Poisoner]] discovery. Until you reach 3rd level, you have 2 reagent dice which can spend only on crafting poisons using this discovery. You can’t later replace this discovery with a different one when you gain a level in this class. Additionally, when you deal poison damage to a creature, you ignore resistance to poison damage and you treat immunity to poison damage as resistance instead, dealing half damage.

## FORMULA:VENOM BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create venom bombs. By mixing a few drops of a fast-acting toxin into your bomb’s explosive components, you can change it into a venom bomb. A venom bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, have disadvantage on the next Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

## ALCHEMICAL ASSASSIN

Beginning at 6th level, you are adept at applying poisons without being seen. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks you make to add ingested poisoned to food or drink, to apply poison to a weapon you are holding without being seen, or to place a vial of poison on another person without them noticing.

## MITHRIDATISM

By 10th level, by administering yourself small doses of various poisons and toxins, you have developed immunity to their ravages. You have immunity to poison damage and to being poisoned.

## TOXIC RECOMPENSE

Starting the 18th level, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to unleash a spray of poisonous vapor. The attacker must make a Constitution saving throw against your bomb save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the creature takes 1d10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
