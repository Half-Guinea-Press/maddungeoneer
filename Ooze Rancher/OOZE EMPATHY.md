# OOZE EMPATHY

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, youâ€™ve developed a pheromone mix which engenders all kinds of slime to you. Whenever an ooze tries to attack you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, its attack misses. On a successful save, the ooze is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.
