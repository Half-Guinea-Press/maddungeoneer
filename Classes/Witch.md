# Witch

Three old crones stoop over a boiling cauldron
filled with all manner of bizarre filth, churning and
bubbling with a noxious fume. In the smoke and
vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes
and figures of great import, and one cackles loudly at
what she sees.
A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from
where the other children play. She glances about to
make sure noone is watching, and snaps her fingers
once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a
black cat appears around the tree’s bend and locks
eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence
for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing
children, a heavy-set boy with a permanently affixed
scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the
boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to
pounce for the boy’s eyes.
A young elf intently mutters something
underneath his breath each time he exhales. Visible
only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out
from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to
its knees in agony.
Witches are stricken by magic so dark it
imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence.
Through force of personality alone, they can spin
this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting
manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar
with their thoughts.
Cursed
While others are blessed with magic, witches are
cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana,
whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are
twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With
gruesome effort, they can warp this power into spells
to wrack others with the same torture which plagues
them.
Pariahs and Outcasts
Almost without exception, witches are feared
and hated. They are victim to a number of
misconceptions, usually relating them to hags and
other evil creatures of the night. As a result, known
witches are in great personal danger and can usually
be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization
where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to
stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some
measure of safety from them.
In reality, very few choose to become witches,
and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using
their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer,
to healer, to apothecary. Being accused as a witch
carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of
the claim, so wise witches relocate frequently, never
residing in one place for too long.
Familiar Masters
It is rare to find a witch without his or her constant
companion, the familiar. Though familiars might
be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch’s
familiar is ubiquitous to common folk for good
reason. Witches command intuitive magic, and have
a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can
conjure more exotic familiars, and command them
more swiftly than other spellcasters.
Creating a Witch
Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful,
malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did
you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your
entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a
bloodline of witches, or did another spellcaster use
sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide
on the nature of your witch’s curse and think about
how you relate to it. Do you feel like the curse was
secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance
burn in your heart?
What negative effects does the curse leverage
on your personality and mind? Are you haunted
by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive
thoughts? How do you feel manipulating the power
of this curse outwards into hexes and spells?
Work with your GM to determine how witches
are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned,
and persecuted? Are you an openly-known witch?
Do the other characters in your party know of your
witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their
magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to
conceal the true darkness of their magic.
QUICK BUILD
To build a witch quickly, make Charisma your
highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Then,
choose the chill touch and minor illusion cantrips,
and the spells hideous laughter and thunderwave.
Lastly, choose the Hideous witch’s curse, and the
hexes Evil Eye and Misfortune.

EQUIPMENT
You start with the following equipment, in addition
to the equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a whip and blowgun, (b) a light crossbow and
20 bolts or, (c) any simple weapon
• (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
• (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack
• Leather armor, any simple weapon, and a dagger
Spellcasting
You have learned to mold and reshape the magic that
curses you into spells.
CANTRIPS
You know four cantrips of your choice from the
witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Witch table.
SPELL SLOTS
The Witch table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To
cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell
bane and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast bane using either slot.
SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL OR HIGHER
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from
the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the
Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells
of your choice.
Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots, as shown on the table.
For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this
class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
level.
Additionally, when you gain a level
in this class, you can choose one of the
witch spells you know and replace it
with another spell from the witch spell
list, which also must be of a level for
which you have spell slots.
SPELLCASTING ABILITY
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch
spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself,
where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use
your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your
proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier
RITUAL CASTING
You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if
that spell has the ritual tag.
SPELLCASTING FOCUS
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus
for your witch spells.
Witch’s Curse
You are wracked by a terrible curse which infects
your body and soul. At 1st level, choose the form that
this curse takes from the options below.
Burned. Almost all of your body has been
scorched by arcane flames, leaving you with striking
black scars and embers of magic that burn under the
skin. As a result, you have resistance to fire damage,
and you know the cantrip produce flame, which does
not count against your total number of cantrips
known.
Drowned. Water fills your lungs, and yet
you do not die. You can breathe air and water.
Additionally, you have a swimming speed equal to
your walking speed.
Feral. Through your curse, you have forgotten
the manners and customs of civilized men and
gone to live among beasts in the wild. Hunting and
fighting daily, you have become savage. You have
proficiency in the Survival skill. Additionally, while
you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield,
your AC equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier.
Hideous. Your appearance is ghastly to behold.
You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. When
you roll initiative, you can choose one humanoid
you can see to scare. That creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or
be frightened until the end of your next turn.
Hollow. Your soul has been divorced from
your body, trapping you in a limbo between life and
death. When you or your familiar reduces a hostile
creature to 0 hit points, you drain some of its life
force, and gain temporary hit points equal to your
witch level + Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
Infested. You are constantly followed by
vermin, like insects and rats, which crawl on your
skin and swarm in your wake. As a result, you are
immune to being diseased.
Additionally, you can command these pests as
your own. Starting at 2nd level, you can choose the
form of a swarm of rats for your familiar. Starting at
7th level, you can choose a swarm of insects.
Loveless. You are cursed to never find true love.
Jaded and disaffected, not even magic can turn your
heart; as a result, you are immune to being charmed.
Possessed. Your soul is occupied by a foreign
spirit that sometimes tries to wrest away your
consciousness. However, while you sleep, the spirit
whispers magical secrets to you. You learn an
additional witch spell at a level for which you have
spell slots at 1st level, and again at 4th level, 8th level,
and 12th level. These spells do not count against your
total number of spells known.
Starving. No matter how much you eat, food
turns to ash in your mouth. Your curse nourishes
you, but only at the edge of starvation, and you are
constantly wracked by pangs of hunger. You don’t
need to eat or drink, but can still imbibe and benefit
from potions. Additionally, you are immune to being
poisoned.
Visions. You are cursed to have terrible visions
of the future, presaging the death of your friends,
family, and yourself. However many of these visions
are cruel deceptions, they are sometimes grimly
accurate. You can add your Charisma modifier, in
addition to your Dexterity modifier, to your initiative
rolls.
Whispers. Unseen voices murmer in your ears
at all times. As such, you can telepathically speak to
any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You
don’t need to share a language with the creature for it
to understand your telepathy, but the creature must
be able to understand at least one language.
Hexes
You can learn a number of powerful incantations,
known as hexes, derived from the same insidious
magic which cursed you.
At 1st level, you gain two hexes of your choice.
Your hex options are detailed at the end of the class
description. When you gain certain witch levels,
you gain additional hexes of your choice, as shown
in the Hexes Known column of the Witch table.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you
can choose one of the hexes you know and replace it
with another hex.
Unless otherwise stated, if a hex calls for an
attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack
bonus or spell save DC. All hexes require verbal or
somatic components (caster’s choice at the time of
casting.)
Unless otherwise noted, if a hex lasts for a
duration, you concentrate on it as you would a spell.
You can concentrate on a hex and a spell at the same
time, and you make only one Constitution saving
throw to maintain your concentration on both.
Cackle
At 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to
cackle. The duration of your hex extends by 1 round
for each creature affected within 60 feet of you.
Not all witches laugh maniacally when they
cackle, but all cackles require a verbal component,
as a spell. These range from mundane curses and
insults, to the murmuring of dead languages and
speaking backwards.
Familiar
At 2nd level, you learn the find familiar spell and
can cast it as a ritual without material components.
The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells
known. The spell is improved in the following ways:
• Your familiar takes its turn immediately before or
after your turn each round (your choice).
• Once per turn as an action or a bonus action, you
can mentally command your familiar to use its
reaction to make one attack.
• When you cast a spell, you can deliver it through
your familiar as if it had cast the spell, even if the
spell doesn’t have a range of touch.
• When you cast the spell, you can choose one
of the normal forms for your familiar or one
of the following special forms: death snail*,
flying book*, homunculus, mock*, moon jelly*,
pet rock*, pseudodragon, rag doll*, sprite, tin
soldier*, winter wolf pup*, and yarn golem*. The
statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk are
in Appendix C.
Witch’s Craft
Your knowledge of magic has culminated in learning
a Craft, an innate variety of magic which exists apart
from the schools of magic. When you reach 3rd level,
choose one Witch’s Craft. Your choice grants you
features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
level.
If your craft grants you a hex at any level, it
doesn't count against your total number of hexes
known.
CRAFT SPELLS
Each craft is associated with a branch of arcana,
represented by a number of spells which you learn.
The levels of these spells are noted in the craft
description. These spells count as witch spells for you
and don’t count against your total number of spells
known.
WITCH FAMILIAR
As a witch, familiars you summon are imbued
with your insidious magic, granting them the
following benefits:
• Your familiar can use your spell attack bonus
for its attack rolls.
• Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to
its Armor Class, saving throws, and damage
rolls.
• You add twice your witch level to your
familiar’s maximum hit points.
Insidious Spell
Starting at 5th level, when you cast a witch spell that
affects a creature that is under the effect of your hex,
that creature has disadvantage on its first saving
throw against the spell. This feature only applies to a
hostile creature which is the sole target of your hex.
Improved Familiar
At 7th level, your familiar’s attacks count as magical
for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance
and immunity. Additionally, you can choose the
following forms for your familiar: brass dragon
wyrmling (without its breath weapon), fright*, grep*,
imp, or quasit. The statistics for creatures marked
with an asterisk are in Appendix C.
Dying Curse
Beginning at 9th level, when a creature reduces you
to 0 hit points but does not kill you outright, you
can lay a nefarious curse upon them. The creature is
cursed for up to 24 hours. While cursed, the creature
has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws. If you regain consciousness or the
creature is targeted by the remove curse spell, the
curse ends at the end of the creature’s next turn.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again
until you finish a long rest.
Grand Hex
By 11th level, you have perfected deeply malevolent
forms of magic. You learn one Grand Hex, and you
learn another at 13th, 15th, and 18th level. Grand
hexes are detailed at the end of the class description.
Hexmaster
By 20th level, you have mastered your foul magic.
Humanoid creatures have disadvantage on saving
throws against your hexes.
HEXES
The Hexes below are presented in alphabetical order.
ABATE
As an action, choose one creature you can see within
60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On
a failed save, the creature can’t take reactions until
the end of your next turn.
APATHY
As an action, choose one creature you can see
within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failed save, until the end of your next
turn, the creature becomes indifferent toward one
creature of your choice that it is hostile towards. This
indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed
by a spell by the creature to which it is indifferent.
When the hex ends, the creature becomes hostile
again, unless the GM rules otherwise.
BECKON FAMILIAR
You can cast the find familiar spell as an action
without expending a spell slot or spell components.
Once you cast this spell in this manner, you can’t do
so again for 1 minute.
You must have the Familiar feature to choose
this hex.
BLEEDING
As an action, choose one creature you can see
within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, each time this creature takes
damage, it loses an additional 1d4 hit points. This
effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
CHARM
As an action, choose one creature you can see within
60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is charmed by you until the end
of your next turn. When the hex ends, the creature
knows it was charmed by you.
DIRE FAMILIAR
As an action, you can bolster your summoned
familiar. For 1 minute, your familiar’s current and
maximum hit points is increased by twice your witch
level and it gains a bonus to its damage rolls equal to
your Charisma modifier.
You can cast other hexes while this hex is in
effect. Once you cast this hex, you can’t cast it again
until your familiar is dismissed, or until its duration
expires.
You must have the Familiar feature to choose
this hex.
DISORIENT
As an action, choose one creature that you can see
within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, whenever this target makes an
attack roll before the end of your next turn, it must
roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the
attack roll.
DOOMWARD
As an action, choose one friendly creature other than
yourself you can see within 60 feet. If this creature
drops to 0 hit points before the end of your next
turn and doesn’t die outright, it drops to 1 hit point
instead. This hex then ends and can’t be used to
target the same creature until you finish a short or
long rest.
DUPLICITY
As an action, you can create an illusory duplicate self,
composed of shadowstuff, to confuse your enemies.
When a creature attacks you, roll any die. On an odd
number, the attack strikes the duplicate and misses,
regardless of its roll, and the hex ends. On an even
roll, the attack targets you as normal. This effect lasts
until the end of your next turn.
EVIL EYE
As an action, choose one creature you can see that
can see you within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of
you until the end of your next turn.
FORTUNE
As an action, choose one friendly creature other than
yourself you can see within 60 feet. The creature has
advantage on saving throws until the end of your
next turn.
GO UNSEEN
As an action, you and your familiar become invisible.
The effect ends at the end of your next turn, or if you
or your familiar attack or cast a spell.
Once you cast this hex, you can’t cast it again for
1 minute.
HOBBLE
As an action, choose one creature you can see within
60 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature’s movement speed is reduced
to 10 feet until the end of your next turn. If the
creature is flying, it falls.
KNOWING
As an action, you open your third eye and become
intuitively aware of your surroundings. You have
advantage on Wisdom (Insight) rolls until the end of
your next turn. Additionally, choose of the following
pieces of information:
• If a creature can speak a language
• If a creature is at or below half its maximum hit
points
• What a creature’s lowest ability score is
You learn that piece of information for each creature
within 30 feet. You can only learn one of these things
about a creature, even if you cast this hex more than
once.
HEXES AND MAGIC
A witch casts their terrible hexes as an extension
of their curse. As their curses are magical in
nature, their hexes are considered 0th-level
spells for the purposes of feature and spells,
such as
counterspell or
dispel magic, which
interact with magic. Furthermore, all hexes
cease while in the area of an
antimagic field or
similar effect.
MIRE
As an action, you can transform the ground within
30 feet of where you cast this hex into murky swamp,
which is difficult terrain. You can move without
penalty in this area. This effect lasts until the end of
your next turn.
MISFORTUNE
As an action, choose one creature you can see within
60 feet. Until the end of your next turn, whenever
this creature rolls a 20 on a d20 roll, the roll instead
becomes a 1.
OBFUSCATE
As an action, you create a 20-foot radius sphere of
fog centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around
corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This effect
lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind
of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per
hour) disperses it.
PEACEBOND
As an action, you can lock weapons to their owners.
The weapons and ammunition of each creature
within 30 feet become locked in their sheaths,
quivers, or holsters until the end of your next turn.
During this time, a creature can use its action to free
its weapon with a Strength check, opposed by your
spell save DC.
POX
As an action, choose one creature you can see within
5 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature is poisoned until the end of
your next turn.
RUIN
As an action, choose one creature you can see within
60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature’s Armor Class decreases by 3,
to a minimum of 10, until the end of your next turn.
SCURRY
As an action, a nonmagical object you choose within
30 feet sprouts legs and runs away. You can’t target an
object that weighs more than 10 pounds, nor can you
target one that is being worn as clothing or armor;
however, you can target certain objects that are
being carried, as long as they are not affixed entirely
around a creature’s body and are not being held in
a hand. For example, you can’t target a creature’s
helmet or a sword it is wielding, but you can target
a drawstring pouch it is wearing or a dagger that is
sheathed at its side.
The object animates, wriggles free of its owner,
if it has one, sprouts two legs, and moves 20 feet in a
direction you choose. At the beginning of your turn,
you can choose which direction the object moves.
The object has an AC of 10, if its AC was not already
higher, and remains animated until the end of your
next turn, or until it is picked up.
SHRIEK
As a bonus action, you can release a thunderous,
blood-curdling screech. Each Large or smaller
creature you choose within 5 feet of you is pushed 5
feet away from you.
SLUMBER
As an action, choose one creature you can see
within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the target falls unconscious until it takes
damage, or until the end of your next turn. Undead,
creatures which are immune to being charmed, and
creatures whose current hit points are greater than
five times your witch level are immune to this effect.
SLUR
As an action, choose one creature you can see within
60 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature can’t speak coherently until the end
of your next turn. If the creature attempts to cast a
spell that requires a verbal component, it must roll a
d20. On an odd roll, the casting fails.
TREMORS
As an action, you can create a small quake. Each
creature on the ground within 10 feet of you must
succeed a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked
prone.
WARD
As an action, choose 1 creature you can see other
than yourself within 60 feet. Each time the creature
takes damage before the end of your next turn, it
reduces the damage it takes by 3.
GRAND HEXES
The Grand Hexes below are presented in alphabetical
order. Unless otherwise stated, if a grand hex calls for
an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack
bonus or spell save DC. Grand hex features do not
count as hexes.
CAULDRON
You can brew potions in a bubbling cauldron using
raw components scavenged from nature. To this end,
you have a pool of alchemy points equal to half your
witch level, rounded down. You regain all expended
alchemy points when you finish a long rest.
You can spend 10 minutes and expend any
number of alchemy points to brew potions. These
potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they
become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it
uses your spell save DC.
The potions available for you to brew are given
on the Cauldron Potions table below.
Cauldron Potions
Potion Alchemy Points
Potion of Animal Friendship 1
Potion of Growth 1
Potion of Healing 1
Potion of Water Breathing 1
Oil of Slipperiness 2
Philter of Love 2
Potion of Greater Healing 2
Potion of Heroism 2
Potion of Resistance 2
Potion of Clairvoyance 3
Potion of Diminution 3
Potion of Gaseous Form 3
COVEN
You can induct others into your insidious coven.
By performing a special ritual over the course of 8
hours, which can be done during a long rest, you
can intermingle your cursed magic with a willing
creature which has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic
feature. This creature enters into your coven. You can
have up to two creatures other than yourself in your
coven at one time.
While two or more members of your coven are
within 30 feet of one another, they gain the ability
to cast additional spells, as shown on the Coven
Spellcasting table. Additionally, members of your
coven gain access to a shared pool of 5 spell slots—
one of each level, from 1st to 5th level—which they
can use to cast any spell known to them. Expended
spell slots are regained when all members of the
coven finish a long rest.
Coven members use their own spellcasting
ability to determine spell attack bonuses and spell
save DCs. A coven member can’t cast spells of a level
for which they do not have personal spell slots, even
if using a higher level shared spell slot. A shared spell
slot can be used, for instance, to cast a lower level
spell at higher levels, but it can’t be used to cast a
spell normally too high-level for a spellcaster.

1st

DUAL HEX
When you cast a hex which targets one creature, you
can target two creatures instead. While both targets
are under the effect of your hex, you gain the benefits
of your Insidious Spell feature against each of them.
FORCEFUL PERSONALITY
Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum
of 22.
HYBRID
As a bonus action, if your familiar is within 5 feet
of you, you can meld with it, transforming into a
magical hybrid. For the next minute, you gain the
following benefits:
• You gain temporary hit points equal to your
familiar’s hit points.
• Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as
you are not holding a shield.
• You gain two natural melee weapons,
corresponding to your familiar’s attacks. You have
proficiency with these weapons, and use Charisma
for the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, these
natural weapons deal 1d10 bludgeoning, piercing,
or slashing damage (your choice).
• You can attack twice, instead of once, when you
take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore
his benefit if you already have a feature, like
Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.
• You can use any action or movement your
familiar possesses.
This transformation lasts one minute or until you
dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When
it ends, your familiar is dismissed, and you can’t
summon it again until you finish a short or long rest.
POISON APPLE
As an action, you can produce a magical apple out of
thin air. This apple can possess whatever appearance
you wish, be that a ruby red coloration, a golden
skin, or the appearance of crystal. On your turn, you
can use your action to eat the apple, granting you the
following benefits:
• You regain hit points equal to twice your witch
level, plus your Charisma modifier.
• You regain an expended spell slot of 5th level or
lower.
• You can end one of the following conditions
affecting you: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or
poisoned.
However, the apple is suffused with your insidious
magic. If a creature other than yourself eats the
apple, it does not gain any benefits and instead must
make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell
save DC with disadvantage. On a failed save, the
creature becomes poisoned for up to 24 hours. For
each hour the creature is poisoned, it loses 4d8 hit
points. This loss can’t be reduced or avoided. If this
reduction causes the creature to drop to 0 hit points,
the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and falls
into a catatonic sleep, remaining unconscious for up
to 7 days. A remove curse spell or similar magic can
awaken this creature early.
The apple shrivels and become nonmagical if it
isn’t eaten in 24 hours. Once you produce a magic
apple, you can’t produce another one until you finish
a long rest.
POSSESSION
As an action, your body becomes immaterial, and
your spirit dives into a Large or smaller creature
you can see within 10 feet of you in an attempt to
possess it. This target must make a Charisma saving
throw. A creature with a challenge rating greater
than your witch level automatically succeeds on this
save. On a failed save, you disappear and the target
becomes incapacitated and possessed; you gain
control of its body but don’t deprive the target of its
awareness. While possessing the creature, you can’t
be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. You
maintain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
ability scores and your alignment, but otherwise use
the creature’s statistics. You don’t gain access to the
target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
For the purposes of spells and effects which
can end possession, such as the spell dispel evil and
good, you are treated as an undead spirit and can
be banished from the target, returning to your own
body, which rematerializes within 5 feet of the target.
This possession lasts for 1 hour, or until the
body drops to 0 hit points or you are forced out by a
spell or other magical effect that ends possession.
Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again
until you finish a long rest.
WAR HEX
When you cast a hex that targets a single creature,
you can use your bonus action to cast a cantrip
targeting the same creature.
WITCH'S BROOM
You can use your action to enchant a mundane
object—like a broom, cauldron, or rug—to fly for you.
You gain a flying speed of 60 feet while holding this
item with one hand, as long as you are not wearing
medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield. You
can only enchant one object using this ability at a
time. If you target another object using this effect,
the enchantment on the previous object ends.
WITCH'S HUT
You can perform a 24-hour long ritual to enchant
a structure which can fit within a 15-foot cube,
animating it as a Huge object, as per the animate
objects spell. The structure rises up on a pair of
magical legs and follows your commands.
The entrance to the structure is linked to an
extradimensional abode, as per the magnificent
mansion spell. You can command the structure
from inside this abode. If the structure is destroyed,
the extradimensional abode is unharmed, but its
occupants are ejected to unoccupied spaces adjacent
to the structure.
As an action, you can teleport the structure to
an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. Once you
teleport the structure, you can’t do it again until you
finish a long rest.
You can repeat the 24-hour ritual to end the
enchantment on your previous structure and enchant
a new one.

WITCH’S CRAFTS
A witch’s craft is distinct from a school of magic.
Whereas magical schools seek to categorize spells,
crafts are defined by the use of magic, and seek to
capture the essence of spells. There are dozens of
varieties, from those practiced by covens in secret, to
those plied in marketplace potion shops.
Each craft has a number of Craft Spells. New
spells are marked with an asterisk.
Black Magic
Black magic is associated with hexes that cause
pain and suffering, and spells which give rise to
undeath. Harnessing such a craft can lend you great
power, but inevitably carries a cost. Darkness cannot
be contained, after all; it merely seeps forth from
wherever it is kept.
Black Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
exhume*, inflict wounds
2nd
gentle repose, magic weapon
3rd
animate dead, vampiric touch
4th
blight, death ward
5th
cloudkill, contagion
HEX:DECAY
When you adopt this craft at 3rd level, you learn to
drain the vitality from a living being. As an action,
choose one creature you can see within 60 feet
to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the
beginning of its next turn and its hit point maximum
is reduced by the amount of necrotic damage taken.
This reduction lasts until the hex ends. The target
dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
This hex ends at the end of your next turn.
UNDEATH COMMAND
Starting at 6th level, you have intertwined the
magic of your familiar with the magic you use to
animate the dead. When you use your bonus action
to command your familiar, you can use the same
bonus action to issue a command to any undead you
control via the animate dead spell or similar magic.
LIFE TETHER
At 10th level, as a reaction when you take damage
from a creature you can see, you can transfer some of
that damage to a creature which is the sole target of
your hex. You take half the damage (rounded down)
and the hexed creature takes the remaining damage.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
BLACK SACRIFICE
Beginning at 14th level, if your familiar is within 10
feet of you, you can use your action to command
it to dissolve its magical bond to this plane, which
unleashes a torrent of necromantic energy. Each
creature you choose within 20 feet must make a
Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A
creature takes 8d10 necrotic damage on a failed save,
or half as much on a successful one, and its hit point
maximum is reduced by the amount of necrotic
damage taken. A target dies if this effect reduces its
hit point maximum to 0. Once you use this ability,
you can’t summon your familiar again until you
finish a long rest.
Blood Magic
Forbidden by most witch covens, blood magic
centers on the use of dark spells and mortal hexes
that draw from the spellcaster’s very essence. It is
fundamentally more perilous than other witch crafts,
but its many risks come with copious rewards.
Blood Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
hellish rebuke, hollowing curse*
2nd
acid arrow, hold person
3rd
ruby-eye curse*, vampiric touch
4th
blight, dominate beast
5th
cloudkill, dominate person
HEX:BLOOD CURSE
Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you
can mark a creature with a sinister blood curse. As
an action, choose one creature you can see within 60
feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, this creature is on the brink of death until the
end of your next turn. If the creature at any point in
this duration has less than its maximum hit points
and has fewer hit points than twice your witch level,
it immediately drops to 0 hit points.
NOVICE HEMOMANCY
Also at 3rd level, when you cast a spell which
requires material components that do not have
a specific cost, you can replace the material
components with a drop of blood.
ARCANE BLOODLETTING
Lastly at 3rd level, you can impel your magic with a
measure of your own blood. When you cast a spell
that has a casting time of 1 action, you can choose
to lose 5 hit points to change the casting time to 1
bonus action for this casting.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
DEATHSEEKER
At 6th level, you can see those near death shrouded
in a crimson aura. Even in heavily obscured
conditions, you can detect the location of creatures
within 60 feet that have less than their maximum hit
points. This sense can penetrate most barriers, but
it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks
you make to track a creature you or your familiar has
damaged.
HEMOMANTIC RECOVERY
Beginning at 10th level, you can perform a blood
ritual to bolster your magic. Once per day when you
finish a short rest, you can spend hit dice to recover
expended spell slots. The cost for each spell slot is
given on the table below. You can’t use this ability to
recover spell slots of 6th level or higher.
Spell Level Hit Dice
1st 2
2nd 3
3rd 5
4th 6
5th 7
SANGUINE
By 14th level, you can wield your own blood like a
vicious lash. Once per round, when you cast a spell
which deals damage to a creature that is under the
effect of your hex, you can choose to lose hit points
to increase the amount of damage dealt. For every 5
hit points you lose you can add 2d8 necrotic damage
to the damage roll, up to a maximum of 6d8 damage.
This feature only applies to a hostile creature which is
the sole target of your hex.
Green Magic
Plants, nature, and things that grow are the
domain of green magic. Normally a type of arcana
championed by druids, some witches have a close tie
to the powers of green magic, and can coax plants
and animals into their bidding.
Green Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
entangle, goodberry
2nd
barkskin, beast sense
3rd
conjure animals, plant growth
4th
conjure woodland beings, stoneskin
5th
awaken, tree stride
HEX:ELDER TONGUE
Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you
know the speech of the forest. As a bonus action,
you can attune yourself to the forest, granting you
the ability to speak with beasts and plants in a
limited manner until the end of your next turn. Most
beasts and plants lack the intelligence to convey or
understand sophisticated concepts, but could relay
what they have seen or heard in the recent past.
While you can speak with them, you have advantage
on all Charisma checks you make to influence beasts
and plants.
PRIMAL ALLY
Also at 3rd level, whenever you summon your
familiar, you conjure one that is hardier than normal.
Add three times your witch level, instead of twice
your witch level, to your familiar’s maximum hit
points.
TWIN FAMILIAR
By 6th level, when you summon your familiar,
you can divide its spirit into two bodies. When
summoned this way, your familiar is two identical
creatures which share a single pool of hit points.
Your twin familiars roll only once for initiative and
act on subsequent turns. You can use your bonus
action to command one twin to attack and your
action to command the other to attack. A spell or
feature which targets or dismisses your familiar
affects both twins.
VITAL NOURISHMENT
By 10th level, you exude an aura of Green
Magic that restores and reinvigorates
life around you. When you finish a long
rest, plant life within 100 feet of where you
finished your long rest grows as if a month had
passed with abundant food, water, and other
necessities. If the plants would produce
fruits, berries, or vegetables, the plants
grow enough food to feed six creatures
for one day.
Additionally, choose up to six creatures
you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures
each gain temporary hit points equal to half your
witch level + your Charisma modifier. You can
also end one disease affecting each creature, or
end one of the following conditions: blinded,
deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
SACRIFICIAL FAMILIAR
At 14th level, whenever you are targeted by a melee
attack while your familiar is within 5 feet of you,
you can use your reaction to command it to dive in
the way of the attack. This attack targets the familiar
instead.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Purple Magic
Purple magic holds sway over the domains of
illusions and enchantments that take hold over
people’s minds, and anything that is not quite as it
seems. Practitioners of this form of magic are puppet
masters, shaping the apparent reality of those around
them to their advantage.
Purple Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
charm person, silent image
2nd
enthrall, invisibility
3rd
hypnotic pattern, major image
4th
confusion, private sanctum
5th
modify memory, seeming
HEX:HALLUCINATION
Starting at 3rd level, you can infect the minds of
other creatures. As an action, choose one creature
you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving
throw. A creature that is immune to being charmed
automatically succeeds on this saving throw. On
a failed save, the target’s perspective of the world
distorts into a horrific and alien place. The creature
has a −1 penalty on all attack rolls and ability checks
it makes. Whenever the creature begins its turn, the
penalty on all attack rolls and ability checks increases
by 1, up to a maximum penalty of −5. This effect lasts
until the end of your next turn.
FALSE AUTHORITY
By 6th level, as an action, you can wrap yourself in
an illusory air of expectation. Any creature which
sees you perceives you as a figure of authority. A
blacksmith might see you as a guild master, whereas
a soldier might see you as a captain. The changes
perceived by a viewer fail to hold up to physical
inspection. This illusion lasts for 1 hour or until you
end it on your turn (no action required).
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can
use its action to inspect your appearance and must
succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
DECEITFUL TRANSPOSITION
Starting at 10th level, you can use your bonus action
to create an illusory disguise over two creatures
within 60 feet of you, making it seem as if they have
teleported and switched places. The disguise makes
it seem that the creatures are in one another’s spaces,
moving all sounds, smells, and other effects caused
by each creature to their correct points of origin.
Creatures under the effect of the disguise do not
perceive any part of the illusion.
A creature can use its action to examine
a magically disguised creature and make an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell
save DC. On a success, the creature can see both
illusory creatures for what they are.
This illusion lasts for 1 minute, and ends early
when one of the illusory creatures takes damage,
or if one of the creatures performs any physical
interaction which reveals itself to be an illusion.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
WAKING NIGHTMARE
By 14th level, you can warp everything a creature
sees into a hellscape, full of terrible creatures that
wish them harm. When a creature fails its saving
throw against your Hallucination hex, you can
further distort its mind, causing it to lose the ability
to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures
it sees as enemies until the hex ends. Whenever the
hexed creature chooses a target for an attack, spell,
or other ability, it must choose the target at random
from among the creatures it can see within range.
The hexed creature must always use its reaction to
make an opportunity attack, if a creature provokes
one.
This effect ends after 1 minute. Once you use
this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a
long rest.
Red Magic
Arcane magic tied to channeling the elements is
deemed red magic, and is extremely hazardous when
used. Witches that specialize in red magic are among
the deadliest spellcasters in existence, channeling
their curse into unhindered arcane wrath.
Red Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
burning hands, magic missile
2nd
acid arrow, scorching ray
3rd
fireball, protection from energy
4th
ice storm, wall of fire
5th
cone of cold, telekinesis
HEX:IMPERIL
Starting at 3rd level, you know how to strip away
your foes’ magical defenses. As an action, choose
one creature you can see within 60 feet to make
a Constitution saving throw, and choose any one
damage type. On a failed save, the creature loses
resistance to the given damage type until the end of
your next turn, or is treated as having only resistance,
if it is immune.
CONVOLUTE ENERGY
At 6th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals acid,
cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you
can gain resistance to that damage type until the end
of your next turn.
INVULNERABILITY
Beginning at 10th level, when an attacker that
you can see hits you with an attack, you can use
your reaction to briefly become invulnerable.
Subtract 50 from the damage dealt, to a
minimum of 0.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use it
again until you finish a long rest.
ELEMENTAL ANNIHILATION
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a witch spell
which deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder
damage, you can expend another spell slot of
equal or higher level to maximize the damage
dealt.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use
it again until you finish a long rest.
Steel Magic
Secret covens throughout the Material
Plane practice their magic by drawing
spells into their blades. Maniacally
cackling and whirling their way across
the battlefield, these witches weave their
curses into a bloody tapestry whenever
they bring their steel to bear.
Steel Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
heroism, shield
2nd
heat metal, magic weapon
3rd
blink, haste
4th
death ward, freedom of movement
5th
flame strike, telekinesis
BONUS PROFICIENCIES
Beginning when you choose this craft at 3rd
level, you gain proficiency with battleaxes, flails,
longswords, morningstars, rapiers, scimitars,
tridents, and warhammers.
HEX:MALEVOLENCE
Also at 3rd level, you have learned a secret hex
associated with the profane rites of long-forgotten
covens. You can use your bonus action to shroud
yourself with an evil smog until the end of your next
turn. You don't need to make Constitution saving
throws to maintain concentration on this hex. You
gain the following benefits:
• Your Armor Class equals 12 + your Dexterity
modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as
you are not holding a shield.
• When you make an attack with a melee weapon
that lacks the Heavy property, you can use
your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or
Dexterity, for its attack and damage rolls.
• Whenever you take damage from a creature
which you can see that is within 5 feet of you, you
can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
attack against that creature.
CACKLING KILLER
At 6th level, when you use your Cackle feature, you
can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.
SOULSWORD FAMILIAR
Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you can
draw the essence of your familiar into your weapon,
manifesting in a cloak of green flame. Your familiar
is dismissed, and can’t be resummoned until you
finish a short or long rest. Until your familiar is
resummoned, this weapon deals an additional 1d8
fire damage on a hit.
SHRIEKING STRIKE
Starting at 14th level, your accursed magic has
seeped into your weapon. Once per turn, when you
hit another creature with a melee weapon attack,
you can perform a shrieking strike. The target must
succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your spell
save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your
next turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).
You regain all expended uses when you finish a long
rest.
Tea Magic
Tea witches are among the calmest and friendliest of
witches, radiating warmth and contentment despite
their hideous faces and hollow souls. At their very
worst, they can be cranky (if forced to drink their tea
in a hurry), or twitchy (after too much tea), but even
then, they are likely to look for peaceful solutions to
their problems.
Tea Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
hideous laughter, sanctuary
2nd
augury, calm emotions
3rd
clairvoyance, sending
4th
divination, private sanctum
5th
legend lore, scrying
HEX:TASSEOGRAPHY
Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you
can see glimpses of the future in your tea leaves. As
an action, choose a friendly creature you can see
within 60 feet, roll a d20, and record the number
rolled. Until the end of your next turn, you can
replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check
made by the creature with this foretelling roll. You
must choose to do so before the roll. Once you
replace a roll in this way, this hex ends.
TEA CEREMONY
Also at 3rd level, you can magically conjure enough
tea for you and your allies whenever you take a short
or long rest. A creature who drinks this tea loses one
additional level of exhaustion during that rest period.
SHAPES AND OMENS
By 6th level, you can see deeper glimpses into the
future through your tea leaves. When you finish a
long rest, you can examine the shape of your tea
leaves. The GM tells you a shape which hints at
future events. For example, if you see a tower in
your tea leaves, you might encounter a wizard on
the following day. If you see a serpent, you might
encounter a liar or a monster.
HERBAL REMEDY
At 10th level, you can cast the spell greater
restoration without expending a spell slot or material
components. Once you use this ability, you must
finish a short or long rest before using it again.
INVIGORATE
By 14th level, as a bonus action, you can give yourself
or a friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of
you a temporary rush of energy by drinking an
energizing cup of tea. On the target’s next turn, the
target can take one additional action on top of its
regular action and a possible bonus action.
Once you use this ability, you must finish a long
rest before using it again.
Technicolor Magic
Technicolor Magic witches draw their power from
the friendships they find around them. They have
a penchant for collecting adorable animals of all
shapes and sizes, which they will never endanger, no
matter how dire the situation. Above all, Technicolor
witches are defined by their relentlessly positive
outlook, which empowers their arcana and spurs on
their allies.
Technicolor Magic Bonus
Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
color spray, speak with animals
2nd
animal messenger, enhance ability
3rd
fly, speak with plants
4th
freedom of movement, locate
creature
5th
animate objects, telepathic bond
ANIMAL FRIENDS
Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you
have advantage on all Wisdom (Animal Handling)
checks you make to befriend beasts. You can use
your Charisma, instead of Wisdom, on these checks
if the creature is Small or smaller. If you adopt a
beast as a pet, you can temporarily dismiss it into an
extradimensional space, as you would a familiar.
HEX:MUSICAL INTERLUDE
At 3rd level, you gain a hex which inspires your allies
with an uplifting speech or an encouraging musical
number. As an action, you can grant each willing
creature you can see which can see you within 30
feet a number of temporary hit points equal to your
Charisma modifier plus half your witch level. These
temporary hit points last until the end of your next
turn.
FRIENDSHIP BRACELET
Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can weave
a small bracelet of string, beads, or some other
inexpensive material. You can always determine the
location of a creature wearing one of these bracelets,
as long as you and it are on the same plane of
existence. You can target the creature with spells and
effects as if you could see it, even if an obstacle or
environmental effect obscures the target from your
view.
POSITIVITY
Starting at 10th level, you can leverage your bonds
of friendship for protection. As an reaction, when a
creature you can see attacks you, you gain a bonus
to your Armor Class equal to the number of friendly
creatures within 5 feet of you.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
REDEMPTIVE ARC
Beginning at 14th level, you can redeem your foes,
instead of slaying them. When a hostile creature you
can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your
reaction to protect the creature from harm, causing
it to fall unconscious. When the creature awakens,
it is freed of any magical effect which would charm,
curse, frighten, or possess it. Furthermore, the
creature loses one of its Bonds or Flaws which
inspired it to be hostile towards you.
Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again
until you finish a long rest.
White Magic
White magic is fundamentally good and benevolent
for all living things. Witches that adopt this craft,
in spite of the hateful curse that infects them, often
dedicate themselves to healing and caretaking, with
the intent of bettering the world.
White Magic Bonus Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st
bless, cure wounds
2nd
lesser restoration, prayer of
healing
3rd
beacon of hope, revivify
4th
death ward, guardian of faith
5th
mass cure wounds, raise dead
HEX:REMEDY
At 3rd level, you learn a hex which closes wounds
and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature
you can see within 60 feet. This creature regains a
number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch
level. A creature which regains hit points from this
hex can’t be affected by it again until it finishes a
short or long rest.
TALISMAN OF PROTECTION
At 6th level, you can craft a talisman which wards off
harm. Creating a talisman takes one hour of work,
which can be performed over the course of a short
rest. You can only have one of these talismans at a
time; crafting a new talisman causes the previous
talisman to become mundane. Any creature that
wears a talisman can add a d4 to all saving throws it
makes.
BENEVOLENT SURGE
At 10th level, when you, your familiar, or one of your
allies you can see within 30 feet takes damage, you
can use your reaction to cause that creature to regain
hit points equal to 1d10 + your Charisma modifier.
Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or
long rest before using it again.
WITCH'S GIFT
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a spell or hex
which restores a creature’s hit points, that creature
gains a +3 bonus to its Armor Class until the end of
your next turn.
