# Shadow Caster

## Shadow Magic

Before time, before light, before life… there was darkness. Even
now, that darkness waits beyond the edge of all things, in the
void beyond worlds and mortals and gods. Eventually, even the
brightest of lights and the greatest of stars must dim and gutter, the
longest day must yield to twilight. Darkness underlies all reality, and
shadow is the only eternity.

Many fail to understand this, claiming darkness is but an absence,
the lack of light. They don’t understand that, as the underpinnings of
all existence, shadow possesses a primal power.
This is especially true of magic, the heart of which is symbolism
and symmetry. If shadow lies beneath the magic, is intertwined
through it, then shadow is magic—and potentially the greatest form
of it. By learning the secrets of natural darkness, emotional darkness,
even otherworldly darkness as manifested by the Plane of Shadow,
those rare few who have skirted the edges of understanding, who
have just begun to grasp at these fundamental truths, can draw upon
the power of shadow and void itself. Thus far, these have proved
the equal of other forms of magic—no weaker, but no greater—but
then, even the most studied and strong-willed have only begun to
scratch the surface.

## The Shadowcaster

Asphere of pitch darkness hovers in the midst of a
brightly lit chamber. Within sits a gaunt human
woman, head thrown back and eyes wide, absorbing
power from the inky shadows surrounding her.
Retreating in horror from the illusion of a twisted
monstrosity phasing through the stone wall, a castle guard
is oblivious to the gnome materializing from the shadows
behind him, hands raised to drain the warmth of life from
his body.

A white-eyed elf steps from within the bounds of a dark
and twisted storm, leaving a trail of unnatural devastation
in her wake. Before anyone can even think to intercept
her, she vanishes into the Plane of Shadow in a swirling
puff of gloom.

Shadowcasters represent those rare few who have come
to understand that night and shadow are a fundamental
source of power, and who possess minds strong and
flexible enough to master the arcane formulae and
incantations required to draw on even the slightest traces
of that power. As obsessive seekers of secret truths, and
as masters—and, some would say, servants—of darkness,
they are a fearful breed. Even good-aligned shadowcasters
know to be careful of how openly they proclaim their
nature and their passions, for few outside their ranks, few
who do not understand the so-called Doctrine of Shadow,
are inclined to trust them.

## The Doctrine Of Shadow

The theories described at the heart of shadow magic—
that darkness underlies all things, that it is the only
true infinity, the most primal of all powers—are known
by those rare scholars who study them as the Doctrine
of Shadow. It is this that all shadowcasters, whether
deliberately or piecemeal, in groups or alone, formally or
through the accidental unearthing of ancient knowledge,
seek to understand.

Shadowcasters require minds capable of mastering the
most complex of equations, while simultaneously holding
onto the most mystifying or even maddening scraps of
larger truths. Some seek power for their own ends, but
all seek understanding, are willing to dismiss accepted
arcane theories, to risk ostracism and even parts of their
own sanity, to comprehend everything the Doctrine has
to teach, and to fill in even a fraction of the many gaps in
mortal understanding of shadow.

Some of the magics one can master through the
Doctrine resemble spells known to other casters, simply
approached from a different angle. Others, however,
are incantations entirely unique to shadowcasters, and
some—known as the Mysteries of Shadow—represent
fundamental changes to the caster’s own nature or access
to even greater magics.

Drawing as they all do on darkness, the Plane of Shadow,
and similar sources, the magics of the shadowcaster are
thematically narrower than those of some other magic
users—though less so than the uninitiated might expect.
Most shadowcasters believe, however, that as they and
their brethren gain a greater understanding of primal
darkness, as the Doctrine of Shadow continues to expand,
both the sort and the strength of magics they can access
will grow.

## Secrets and Lore

All shadowcasters seek a greater understanding of magic
and the nature of reality in general, and of shadow in
particular. This alone is enough to make them appear
strange or even downright alien to most others, and that’s
before one considers the personal goals and ambitions of
any shadowcaster. Between that and suspicions levied
against their source of power, they are often forced into a
measure of solitude. Anyone able to assist them in delving
deeper into their studies, however, or simply offering
companionship and alliance, once proven trustworthy,
finds shadowcasters to be eager associates.

They are particularly eager to interact and trade secrets
with warlocks, whose reputations are often as questionable
as the shadowcasters’ own, and whose own pact magics
bear some superficial resemblances to shadow magic.
Similarly, they enjoy discussing arcane lore with the more
mistrusted and solitary of wizards, such as necromancers.
Any delve, adventure, or study is a potential source of
learning for a shadowcaster, and they often find the most
minuscule or obscure details fascinating. They thirst for
understanding, and consider the loss of new lore far worse
than the failure to acquire a treasure or to accomplish a
particular goal.

Despite their reputation—as well as that of the
powers they draw on and associate with—good-aligned
shadowcasters are no less common than their neutral or evil
counterparts. Most lean toward lawful alignments, due to
the sheer discipline required to master bizarre formulae and
to hold alien and often seemingly contradictory theories in
mind, but neutral shadowcasters are not uncommon, and
even chaotic ones are not unheard of.

## Creating a Shadowcaster

Think about how you became what you are. What inspired
you to study a form of magic—and a philosophy of the
nature of reality—so different from all others, so greatly
mistrusted? What drove you to such lengths to satisfy your
curiosity, even at the risk of ostracism or madness? How
did you even learn of shadow magic, let alone begin to find
sufficient lore or an experienced shadowcaster to teach you?
What do you plan to do with this dark power now that you
have it? Is understanding it sufficient? Were you planning
to do terrible things with it, assuming that shadow magic
must be a power of evil? If so, how have your plans—how
have you—changed now that you know better?

What about your relations with others? Do most people
shun you for your fascination with darkness, assuming
you insane or even threatening? How has this influenced
the degree to which you value those few who do not judge
you, who are willing to stand by you? Or have you avoided
suspicion thus far, hiding the source of your magic and
the true extent of what you can do, masquerading as a
more traditional sort of spellcaster? Are you adventuring
solely to amass further knowledge? To attain some other
personal goal? Simply to prove yourself as something
other than the lone eccentric or even looming villain that
others see you as?

## Quick Build

You can make a shadowcaster quickly by following
these suggestions. Intelligence should be your highest
score, followed by either Dexterity or Charisma. Choose
the sage background to represent your earlier mystic
studies. Finally, choose the arrow of dusk, black candle,
and thaumaturgy cantrips, as well as hypnotic shade and
whichever 1st-level spell is added to your spell list by
your Penumbral Way subclass.

PenuMBraL way
All shadowcasters draw on the magics of darkness, the
void, and the Plane of Shadow, but each must choose a
particular method or school of doing so. These include the
way of the Dread Witch, the way of the Noctimancer, and
the way of the Shadow Scion. Your choice of Penumbral
Way grants you features at 1st level, and again at 6th,
10th, and 14th level.
shadow MagiC
Your study of the Plane of Shadow and of darkness,
along with your more general arcane research, have
granted you the ability to cast a variety of spells, many
of which are intrinsically tied to shadow and known to
no other casters.
CANTRIPS
You know three cantrips of your choice from the
shadowcaster spell list. You learn additional shadowcaster
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown on the
Cantrips Known column of the Shadowcaster table.
SPELL SLOTS
The Shadowcaster table shows how many spell slots you
have. The table also shows what the level of those slots
is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of
your shadowcaster spells of 1st level or higher, you must
expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a short or long rest.
For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-
level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell dusk and dawn,
you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a
3rd-level spell.
SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice
from the shadowcaster spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Shadowcaster table
shows when you learn more shadowcaster spells of your
choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be
of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot
Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level,
for example, you learn a new shadowcaster spell, which
can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you
can choose one of the shadowcaster spells you know and
replace it with another spell from the shadowcaster spell
list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. (Remember, however, that many Mysteries require
you to have completed Paths, or to have access to a certain
number of Paths, as part of their prerequisite. If you no
longer meet these prerequisites due to replacing a spell,
you lose access to that Mystery’s benefits.)
SPELL PATHS
In addition to being divided by level, as with other
classes, shadowcaster spells are also divided into related
groups of three called Paths. Initiate-level Paths include
spells of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level; Intermediate-level Paths
of 4th, 5th, and 6th level; and Master-level Paths of 7th,
8th, and 9th level. (You learn spells of 6th level and above
by taking certain Mysteries, not through your standard
shadow magic class feature. Mysteries are magical or
supernatural abilities you possess, as described below.)
In most ways, these Paths are purely thematic, like spell
schools. You are not required to complete a Path once
begun, nor are you required to choose spells from a Path
in order. When you learn a 5th-level spell, for instance, it
need not come from the same Path as any 4th-level spells
you know.
Certain Mysteries, however, do require that you have
completed a Path in order to take them, while others
require that you have access to spells from multiple
different Paths. Thus, depending on which Mysteries
you wish to take, it may be more advantageous to focus
your spells and complete a few Paths; or go for a broad
selection of abilities instead. Each has its advantages.
SPELLCASTING ABILITY
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your
shadowcaster spells, so you use your Intelligence
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a shadowcaster spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC =
8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier =
your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
SPELLCASTING FOCUS
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for
your shadowcaster spells.
eyes of nighteyes of night
At 2nd level, you gain darkvision 60 feet (or an additional
60 feet, if you already have darkvision), and you suffer
no disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks when the
area you are in, or into which you are looking, is obscured
by dim light.
Mysteries of shadow
As you delve deeper into your investigations of night,
of the void, of the Plane of Shadow, you learn scraps
and snippets of larger, incomprehensible eldritch truths.
These secrets, known as Mysteries of Shadow, grant
you additional mystical abilities, powers, or simple
understanding. At their highest levels, some even grant
you the ability to cast spells of higher level than your
shadow magic spell slots would normally permit.
At 2nd level, you gain two Mysteries of Shadow of
your choice. Your mystery options are detailed at the
end of the class description. When you gain certain
shadowcaster levels, you gain additional mysteries of
your choice, as shown in the Mysteries Known column of
the Shadowcaster table.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you
can choose one of the mysteries you know and replace it
with another mystery that you could learn at that level. A
level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
gLoaMing feastgLoaMing feast
When you reach 3rd level, your bond to the Plane of
Shadow allows you to absorb tenebrous energies that
fulfil or mitigate certain biological needs. You no longer
require food or drink. Additionally, you only need four
hours of sleep (or trance for only two, if you’re an elf),
which is sufficient for you to finish a long rest. At 8th
level, your needs lessen even further, to a single hour
of sleep (or half an hour of trance) per night. At 13th
level, you become immune to nonmagical disease and
poison. Finally, at 18th level, you no longer need to
breathe, and never require sleep or trance. Magic can’t
put you to sleep.
aBiLit y sCore iMProveMentaBiLit y sCore iMProveMent
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.
shade-touChed souLshade-touChed souL
At 7th level, the darkness with which you so regularly
interact has wound itself into your sense—and strength—
of self. You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws,
if you do not already have it.
never-ending nightnever-ending night
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no spell
slots remaining, you regain 1 Shadow Magic spell slot.
PenuMBraL waysPenuMBraL ways
All shadowcasters are a bit odd, even compared to other
spellcasters. The effort to understand the metaphysical
meaning and powers of darkness, of the Plane of
Shadow’s influence on the real world, is stressful to even
the strongest minds, requiring mastery of formulae and
arcane theories that fly in the face of sanity.
Thus, in order to avoid shattering their minds, all
shadowcasters approach their art through one specific
aspect of darkness, one particular area where—be it
factually or thematically—the Plane of Shadow overlaps
reality. This combination of approach and framework
of study is called a Penumbral Way. Three of the most
common focus on fear as a representation of inner
darkness; on the intertwining of shadow’s influence
on magic itself; and on the literal connection between
planes, where the Plane of Shadow actually affects the
environment of the Material Plane.
dread witChdread witCh
The so-called Dread Witch approaches shadow magic
through the lens of the sentient mind. The darkness
within—fear, primarily, but also despair and other
“negative” emotions as well—form a conduit to the
darkness beyond that of the rational world. By learning to
manipulate terror, both their own and others’, the Dread
Witch learns to tap into greater and more tangible magics
as well.
EXPANDED SPELL LIST
Due to their focus on fear and related “dark” emotions,
Dread Witches can select from an expanded list of spells
when learning shadowcaster spells. The following
spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell
list for you.
DREAD HEART

DREAD PRESENCE
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
In addition, as an action, you can cause each creature in
a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom
saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC.
Creatures that fail their saving throws are frightened by
you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this
ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or
long rest.
FEAR-WIELDER
At 6th level, whenever you make a Charisma
(Intimidation) check, you add double your
proficiency bonus to the check instead of
your normal proficiency bonus.
In addition, when you are subject to
an effect meant to cause you to become
frightened—even if you successfully
save or are immune to fear—you
can choose to gain a special form
of inspiration that you must spend
before the end of your next turn. You
can gain this even if you already have
inspiration. Once you use this feature,
you can’t do so again until you finish a
short or long rest.
DREAD MASTER
Beginning at 10th level, you gain
resistance to psychic damage.
In addition, you are immune to fear, and
when another creature targets you with an
effect that causes the frightened condition, you
can use your reaction to turn the fear back on
that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC or
be frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat
the save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.
LIVING NIGHTMARE
Starting at 14th level, you can tap into a creature’s
subconscious fears. As an action, choose a creature
with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that isn’t a construct
or undead within 60 feet of you. If the creature requires
sleep, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your
shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failed save, you have
gained access to its subconscious mind, though it is not
aware of that fact.
If the target falls asleep at any point within the next
24 hours, so long as it remains on either the same plane
as you or on the Plane of Shadow, you instantly become
aware of that fact and can enter a trance as if you cast the
dream spell on the target. You must choose the monstrous
version of the spell, and you are the messenger.
When the target awakens, you are aware it has done
so and can choose to immediately teleport to a space
within 15 feet of the target that it can see. The target is
automatically surprised.
Once you use Living Nightmare, you can’t do so again
until after a long rest.
noCtiManCer
All shadowcasters understand that shadow is the truest,
most fundamental aspect of reality. Take away light, there
is darkness; take away heat, there is cold. Noctimancers,
or night mages, focus on the shadow that underlies magic.
Through their studies, they learn not only to tap into the
power of the Plane of Shadow, but to use the underlying
reality to manipulate magic itself.
EXPANDED SPELL LIST
Their ability to weave shadow into other, more traditional
forms of magic allows Noctimancers to select from an
expanded list when learning shadowcaster spells. The
following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster
spell list for you.
EMANATIONS UNNATURAL
1st level detect magic
2nd level arcanist’s magic aura
3rd level dispel magic
ARCANA UNBOUND
4th level freedom of movement
5th level eldritch twilight*
6th level spell echo*
THE WEAVE UNMADE
7th level spell turning*
8th level antimagic field
9th level eclipse arcane*
*- indicates a new spell presented in this book
KNOWLEDGE ARCANE
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.
In addition, you learn to cast comprehend languages and
identify as rituals, without requiring material components.
You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve
learned them by some other means.
ELDRITCH WARD
At 6th level, whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana)
check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the
check instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
Also, when you are targeted by a spell that either
requires an attack roll or forces you to make a saving
throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage
on the attack roll or to gain advantage on the saving throw.
(If a spell involves both an attack roll and a saving throw,
you impose disadvantage on the attack roll but gain no
benefit on the save.) One you use this ability, you can’t do
so again until you finish a short or long rest.
ARCANE SECRETS
At 10th level, choose three spells from the wizard spell
list that do not also appear on the shadowcaster spell list:
one 1st-level spell, one 2nd-level (or lower) spell, and one
3rd-level (or lower) spell. You add these to your spells
known, and they are shadowcaster spells for you.
At 14th level, add one additional wizard spell that does not
appear on your shadowcaster spell list, of 4th level or lower,
to your spells known. It is a shadowcaster spell for you.
MYSTIC SIPHON
Starting at 14th level, when you successfully use counterspell,
dispel magic, or similar magics to negate an existing spell of
1st level or higher cast by another creature, you can capture a
shred of the magic you just unwove and bend it to your own
purpose. Choose one of the following effects.
• If the spell level is 4th level or higher, regain a spent
shadowcaster spell slot. This spell slot lasts for 1
minute, and then fades away if unused.
• Cure one disease afflicting you.
• Remove one level of exhaustion afflicting you.
• End one of the following conditions afflicting you: blinded,
deafened, restrained (if caused by magic), or poisoned.
• Make an immediate saving throw against one ongoing
effect or condition afflicting you that is ended by a
saving throw. If the effect is one that gets worse on a
failed save, this extra saving throw does not worsen
the effect if it fails.
• Gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw made within 1 minute. You can’t choose this option
again until you expend the advantage it grants.
• Regain 1d6 hit points per level of the spell you
countered or dispelled.
shadow sCionshadow sCion
Perhaps the most straightforward of the Umbral Ways,
the Shadow Scion studies the movement of the Plane of
Shadow and the dark energies that permeate it, through
its interactions and overlap with the Material Plane. By
manipulating planar boundaries they can not only weave
magic of shadows, but use the environment of the Plane
of Shadow to alter portions of the physical world.
EXPANDED SPELL LIST
Their studies allow Shadow Scions to select from an
expanded list when learning shadowcaster spells. The
following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster
spell list for you.
BREATH OF THE SHADOW

WARDING SHADE
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.
In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you that
you can see hits you with an attack, the shadows of the
environment lash out on your behalf. You can use your
reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution
saving throw. The creature takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one. Once you have used this ability, you
can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
CHILD OF TWO WORLDS
As of 6th level, you no longer suffer exhaustion from
extremes of heat or cold, nor do you have disadvantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to wind or rain.
Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can
choose to infuse yourself with the essence of the Plane of
Shadow. You gain resistance to cold damage and necrotic
damage, but vulnerability to radiant damage, until you
finish a long rest.
FLESH OF SHADOW
Starting at 10th level, as an action, you can transform into
a shadow elemental. You revert to your normal form after
a number of hours equal to half your shadowcaster level,
when you spend a bonus action to do so, if you drop to 0
hit points, if you fall unconscious, or if you die.
Your game statistics are replaced by those of the
elemental, except as follows. You retain your alignment,
personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.
You also retain all of your skill and saving throw
proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the shadow
elemental. If the elemental has the same proficiency as
you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours,
use the elemental’s bonus instead of yours.
When you transform, you assume the elemental’s hit
points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal
form, you return to the number of hit points you had
before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result
of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries
over to your normal form.
While transformed, you cannot cast spells, though
transforming does not break your concentration on a spell
you’ve already cast or prevent you from taking actions
that are part of a spell you’ve already cast. You can speak,
but only in a whisper, and must be within 10 feet of
another creature for it to hear you.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them if the elemental is
physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use
any of your special senses unless the elemental also has
that sense.
You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground
in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment
that merges with your elemental form has no effect until
you leave the form.
Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again
until you complete a short or long rest.
MAELSTROM OF SHADOW
Starting at 14th level, you can draw forth a temporary
funnel cloud of shadow-stuff. As an action, choose one
5-foot square within 60 feet that you can see. A column
of swirling cloud and darkness descends from the sky
(or ceiling) to touch the ground in that space and lasts
until the end of your next turn. A creature in the column
when it appears, or who enters the column for the first
time during a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw
against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failure,
the creature is restrained.
The area is heavily obscured. A creature restrained by
the column can’t sense or affect the world outside the
column, and nothing outside the column can affect the
creature. It sees only swirling darkness, hears only the
roar of winds on the Plane of Shadow.
At the end of your next turn, just before the funnel
vanishes, the creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and
5d10 damage of one other type of your choice: either
cold, lightning, or thunder.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.
Mysteries of shadowMysteries of shadow
If a mystery has prerequisites, you must meet them to
learn it. You can learn the mystery at the same time that
you meet its prerequisites. If you later cease to meet
the prerequisite—perhaps because you’ve traded out a
necessary spell or other mystery—you lose all benefits of
that mystery until you once again meet the prerequisites.
You can only select a given mystery once, unless the
mystery description specifies otherwise.
ANIMATE SHADOW
You can cast unseen servant at will, without requiring
material components and without expending a spell slot.
Once you have done so, you must finish a short rest before
you can do so again. You do not have a shadow during the
duration, as it becomes the unseen servant.
ASCENDANT SHADE
Prerequisite: 11th level
As an action, you gain the benefits of both the levitate and
water walk spells with a duration of concentration up to
10 minutes.
BALEFUL SHADE
Prerequisite: 5th level
You can cast bestow curse once using a shadowcaster spell
slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
CHILD OF NIGHT
You learn the find familiar spell. This spell doesn’t count
against your number of spells known.
Your familiar, regardless of what form it takes, is
clearly a creature of shadow. It is unnaturally dark of hue;
wisps of darkness trail from its skin and eyes. It gains
darkvision 60 feet (if it doesn’t already have it). While
the familiar is in dim light or darkness, attacks against
the familiar have disadvantage unless the attacker can see
the familiar clearly. While the familiar is in bright light,
it has disadvantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
CREEPING SHADOW
Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster
spell from three separate Initiate-level Paths
You learn two additional shadowcaster cantrips, beyond
those shown in the Cantrips Known column of the
shadowcaster table.
You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must
know three additional qualifying spells each time; you
can’t use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once.
So, for instance, you could select this mystery a second
time once you know spells from six total Initiate Paths, a
third time if you know spells from nine, and so forth.
DARK CONDUIT
Prerequisite: 5th level
You have learned to cast spells through the edges of the
Plane of Shadow so that their passage through the Material
Plane is warped. As a bonus action, choose a target that you
could clearly see at any point since the start of your last
turn, but that you can no longer see. Before the end of your
turn, you can cast a spell that targets only that creature even
if the spell requires you to see your target. In addition, the
target gains no benefit of being invisible to you, and it gains
no protection from cover against this spell. You must be
aware of a target’s presence to use this feature on it.
DARKEST CREEPING SHADOW
Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster
spell from three separate Master-level Paths
You learn one additional shadowcaster cantrip or 1st-
level shadowcaster spell (your choice of which), and
one additional shadowcaster spell of 4th level or lower,
beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known and Spells
Known columns of the shadowcaster table.
DISTANT VISIONS
Prerequisite: 15th level
You can cast clairvoyance without expending a spell slot
or requiring components.
EMISSARY OF NIGHT
You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill, and in your
choice of either the Intimidate or Sleight of Hand skill.
FUNDAMENTALS OF SHADOW
Choose three shadowcaster cantrips that you know. You
no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly material
components to cast those cantrips (you can still benefit
from using an arcane focus).
In addition, you can choose to cast one of these cantrips
as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a
spell as a bonus action using this feature, you can’t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest.
You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing
three different cantrips each time.
GREATER CREEPING SHADOW
Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster
spell from three separate Intermediate-level Paths
You learn one additional shadowcaster cantrip and one
1st-level shadowcaster spell, beyond those shown in
the Cantrips Known and Spells Known columns of the
shadowcaster table.
You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must
know three additional qualifying spells each time; you can’t
use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once. So, for
instance, you could select this mystery a second time once
you know spells from six total Intermediate Paths.
GREATER PATH SAVANT
Prerequisite: Path Savant
Choose an Initiate-level or Intermediate-level Spell
Path to which you have already applied the Path Savant
mystery. You can cast one spell of 5th level or lower from
that Path, at your normal shadowcaster spell slot level,
without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery,
you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
You can take this mystery multiple times, applying it to
a different qualifying Path each time.
GUARDIAN SHADE
Prerequisite: 3rd level
As an action, you animate your own shadow to fight for
you in battle. It materializes in an unoccupied space within
5 feet of you as a shadow, with the following alterations:
• It is an elemental instead of undead.
• It shares your alignment.
• It can’t create new shadows.
You must concentrate to maintain this effect, as though
it were a spell. The shadow remains active until you cease
concentrating, until it is reduced to zero hit points, or 1
minute, at which point it returns to its normal form. You
don’t cast a shadow for the duration. Once you use this
mystery, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
When you reach 5th level, you manifest two shadows
rather than one. This increases to three at 11th level, and
four at 17th level.
LIFE-TAKER
Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one cantrip that
deals necrotic or cold damage
When you cast a cantrip that deals necrotic and/or cold
damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage that
cantrip deals. If the cantrip affects more than one target,
choose which target takes the extra damage.
LONGSHADOW
When you cast the dancing lights, message, minor
illusion, or thaumaturgy cantrip, its range is doubled.
MASTER OF DEEPEST SHADOW MAGIC

Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6th, 7th, or 8th level.
You can cast this spell once, as though cast using an 8th-
level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this

for purposes of determining whether you’ve completed a
Path, and how many Paths you have access to.
MASTER OF GREATER SHADOW MAGIC
Prerequisite: 13th level
Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6th or 7th level. You
can cast this spell once, as though cast using a 7th-level
slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this
mystery, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
A spell obtained by this mystery counts as a known spell
for purposes of determining whether you’ve completed a
Path, and how many Paths you have access to.
MASTER OF SHADOW MAGIC
Prerequisite: 11th level
Choose one 6th-level shadowcaster spell. You can cast this
spell once, as though cast using a 6th-level slot, without
expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you
can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
A spell obtained by this mystery counts as a known spell
for purposes of determining whether you’ve completed a
Path, and how many Paths you have access to.
MASTER OF SUPREME SHADOW MAGIC
Prerequisite: 17th level
Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6th, 7th, 8th, or 9th
level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using
a 9th-level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you
use this mystery, you can’t use it again until you finish a
long rest.
A spell obtained by this Mystery counts as a known spell
for purposes of determining whether you’ve completed a
Path, and how many Paths you have access to.

Additionally, if you spend any number of hit dice after a
short rest spent in darkness, you can remove one level of
exhaustion.
PATH SAVANT
Prerequisite: At least one complete Spell Path
Choose a Spell Path for which you know all three spells.
You no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly
material components to cast spells from that Path (You
can still benefit from using an arcane focus).
In addition, you can choose to cast one of these spells
as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a
spell as a bonus action using this feature, you can’t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest.
You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing
three different cantrips each time.
SHADOW STEP
Prerequisite: 7th level
When you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a
bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied
space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.
STEEL SHADOWS
You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without
expending a spell slot or material components. As a
bonus action, you can end the spell immediately to gain
advantage on one Dexterity (Stealth) check you make
before the end of your turn. Once you end the spell in this
way, you can’t use Steel Shadows again until you finish
a short or long rest.
SWIFTER THAN THE EYE
Prerequisite: 5th level
When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 bonus
action, you can use your action to cast a spell with a
casting time of 1 action. Once you use this mystery, you
can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
TOUCH OF DARKNESS
You can cast spider climb on yourself without expending
a spell slot. In addition, all ability checks made to track
you have disadvantage, and you can walk across water
and other liquids, but you must end your turn on solid
ground or Touch of Darkness ends immediately.
Once you use this mystery, you can’t do so again until
you finish a short or long rest.
When you reach 11th level as a shadowcaster, you
no longer need to concentrate on spider climb when
casting Touch of Darkness.
TWILIGHT EXPERTISE
Prerequisite: Proficiency in Sleight of Hand or Stealth

(Stealth) check in dim light or darkness, as long as
you are proficient in that skill, you add double your
proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal
proficiency bonus.

shadowcaster spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

shadowCastershadowCaster
sPeLL desCriPtionssPeLL desCriPtions
Note that most shadowcaster spells clearly have an
element of darkness to them, even if the spell normally
would not. Weather effects include unnaturally inky
clouds and streams of shadow amidst the precipitation,
for instance, while physical objects they create or
summon are murky of hue and shot through with inky,
fluctuating veins. Only those spells whose effectiveness
would be compromised by such obvious effects, such as
illusions, lack these traits.
ARROW OF DUSK
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You launch a bolt of inky darkness at a creature or object
within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the
target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 points of cold damage and
has disadvantage on the next Strength or Dexterity check
it makes before the start of your next turn.
A living creature reduced to 0 hit points by arrow of
dusk falls unconscious and is stable, rather than dying or
making death saves.
The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
BEND PERSPECTIVE (VISIONS AND VEILS)
1st-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small prism)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a point you can see within range. You create an
invisible magical sensor at that spot. You see through
the sensor as though you were at that spot. Creatures
that can see invisible objects see an eyeball in shades of
black and gray.
As a bonus action, you can switch your viewpoint to
your true position or back to the sensor. If you make an
ability check, attack roll or saving throw that relies on
Strength or Dexterity while your perspective occupies the
sensor, you do so with disadvantage.
As an action, you can move the sensor up to 15 feet to
another point within range. If you move farther than 30
feet from the sensor, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the range increases by 10 feet
for each slot level above 1st.
BLACK CANDLE
Illusion cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, M (a candle wick or a bit of wax)
Duration: 1 hour
You create a tiny mote of illumination on an object that
is no larger than 5 feet in any dimension. The object
sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, and dim light for an
additional 5 feet beyond that. Choose up to five creatures
when you cast this spell. Only you and the chosen
creatures can see or benefit from the light. The spell ends
if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.
If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature,
that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to
avoid the spell.
CARPET OF SHADOW (SHADOWS SPREAD)
1st-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A thick layer of darkness coats the ground in a 15-foot
radius from a point you can see within range. For the
duration, the affected area is difficult terrain.
Each creature in the area when you cast the spell must
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained
by the semisolid shadow until the spell ends. A creature
restrained by the spell can use its action to make a
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC.
On a success it frees itself.
Shadowcasters using the Touch of Darkness Mystery
are immune to all effects of this spell.
CONJURE UMBRAL SERVANT
5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (coal dust and crushed onyx)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You call forth a shadow elemental to serve you. In all
other respects, this spell is identical to conjure elemental.
CONTROL WEATHER (THE SHADOW BLEEDS)
When casting control weather as a shadowcaster spell,
you cannot raise the temperature to hotter than “cool,”
and you cannot reduce precipitation to less than “overcast
or ground fog.” Otherwise, the spell functions as normal.
CURTAIN OF GLOOM (SHADOWS SPREAD)
3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a few black or gray threads)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you
can see within range. The wall appears in any orientation
you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can
be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall
can be up to 40 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick.
The wall is opaque, and its area is heavily obscured by
magical darkness.
Passing through the wall is particularly disorienting.
Each time a creature enters the wall or starts its turn there,
it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the rest of the creature’s movement is in the opposite
direction the creature intended. Creatures that do not rely
on sight, can see in magical darkness, or are native to the
Plane of Shadow are immune to this effect of the wall.
DANCING SHROUD (WRITHING GLOOM)
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a short length of black rope or cord)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You summon wisps and tendrils of semisolid shadow
in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within range.
The shadows are difficult terrain and can impede up to
six creatures of your choice that you can see. When the
spell is cast and when a chosen creature starts its turn in
the area, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
On a failed save, the creature is restrained. If a creature
restrained in this way attempts to cast a spell, it must
make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure,
the spell fails, and the spell slot or usage is lost. It can use
its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the restrained
condition on itself on a success.
DOUSE
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous, or up to 1 hour
You infuse the light before you with shade. All nonmagical light
sources the size of a campfire or smaller in a 60-foot cube originating
from you are affected. Choose one of the following options:
Affected light sources now shed dim light out to the range
they normally shed bright light for 1 hour. Creatures have
resistance to any fire damage shed by affected light sources.
You can extinguish one light source in the area, causing
it to shed no light. If the light source was fire, the fire goes
out. If the sources were some other form of nonmagical light
such as luminous fungi, they are extinguished for 1 hour.
As a bonus action, you can end the effects of the spell
(extinguished flames don’t reignite). Small or larger creatures
who produce nonmagical light are immune to this spell.
DUSK AND DAWN (SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
You can raise or lower the ambient light within range
by one “step”—changing bright light or darkness to dim
light, or changing dim light to bright light or darkness. At
any time during the duration, you can spend an action to
change the level again (though you can never change it to
two “steps” beyond its ambient level).
Darkvision and magical light function normally in dim
light and darkness created by this spell.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the effect increases
by 15 feet for each slot level above 1st.
ECLIPSE ARCANE (THE WEAVE UNMADE)
9th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (60-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
All ongoing spells of 7th level or lower within the radius
are automatically dispelled, as per dispel magic. For each
spell of 8th or 9th level in the area, make an ability check
using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the
spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.
When casting eclipse arcane, you can choose to exclude any
spell effects currently affecting you or objects in your possession.
ELDRITCH TWILIGHT (ARCANA UNBOUND)
5th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Shadowy tendrils intertwined with threads of magic
expand in a 20-foot sphere from a point you can see
within range. The area becomes dim light for the duration.
The mystic shadows interfere with spellcasting. A creature
within the area that attempts to cast a spell, or a creature
outside the area that casts a spell targeting anything in the
area, must make an ability check using their spellcasting
ability against your spell save DC. Targets proficient in the
Arcana skill can add their proficiency bonus to the roll,
even if their spellcasting ability is not Intelligence. On a
failure, the spell fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted.
Shadowcasters who are outside the spell’s area can cast
their spells into the area normally.
EPHEMERAL IMAGE
(DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)
9th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 1,000 miles
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
You create a duplicate of yourself, made up semisolid
shadow, anywhere within range that you can see or have
seen before. This functions identically to the spell project
image, with the following alterations:
• Because the illusion is semisolid, mild physical
interaction with it does not reveal it to be an illusion.
A successful attack, or a creature that uses its action
to physically examine the image and succeeds on an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell
save DC reveals the image’s true nature.
• The image can manipulate small objects, as per the
mage hand spell.
• You can cast spells of 5th level or lower through the
image, as though you occupied its space.
• The illusion can fly at its normal speed (twice your
walking speed). If you restrict its movement in a
given round to half that speed, you can cause it to
move as a bonus action rather than a normal action.
• If the illusion takes damage, you can make a Constitution
saving throw as if you took the damage dealt to the
image. If you succeed, the illusion doesn’t disappear.
EPHEMERAL STORM
(THE SHADOW BLEEDS)
7th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 200 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A tumult of slicing shadows and white lightning crash
down from the heavens in a 15-foot radius around a point
you can see within range. Each creature in the area must
make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 lightning
damage and 5d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one.
When you cast the spell, you can choose a number of
creatures you can see equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of 1) to be unaffected by it.
FAR SIGHT (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)
8th-level divination
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a mirror or reflective ball made of
polished obsidian, worth at least 1,500 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
This spell functions as scrying, but you also gain the
benefits ofcomprehend languages, detect magic, and true
seeing through the sensor.
FLAME BLADE (FORGED OF NIGHT)
When you cast flame blade as a shadowcaster spell, the
blade created is a twisting saber life-draining gloom. The
spell deals necrotic damage.
FLICKERING MOTES
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Up to 8 hours
Choose one creature within range. The target must make
a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is beset
with tiny shadows at the corner of its vision. The target
has disadvantage on the next Intelligence or Wisdom
check it makes, or on its passive Perception against the
next Dexterity (Stealth) check made to hide from it. The
spell then ends.
The spell ends if you cast it again.
HELLISH REBUKE
(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)
When you cast hellish rebuke as a shadowcaster spell, the
spell causes the target to writhe in frigid shadows. The
spell deals your choice of cold or necrotic damage.
HYPNOTIC SHADE (WRITHING GLOOM)
1st-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small mirror, polished coin, or
other means of creating a flickering light)
Duration: 1 minute
A writhing, shifting pattern of shadow appears at a point
you can see within range. Roll 5d8; the total is how many
hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures
within 30 feet of the chosen point, and who can see it,
are affected in ascending order of their current hit points.
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit
points, each creature affected by this spell is charmed
until the spell ends. A creature charmed in this way is
paralyzed. The charmed condition ends if the creature
takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap
the creature out of its stupor. Subtract each creature’s hit
points from the total before moving on to the creature with
the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be
equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature
to be affected.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each
slot above first.
IMPRISONMENT (WORLDS APART)
When you cast imprisonment as a shadowcaster spell, you
must select either the “burial” or “hedged prison” options.
INFINITE MIRROR (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)
7th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a small mirror or prism)
Duration: Concentration, up to ten minutes
You instantly become aware of and can see any magical
sensors (such as arcane eye, or those created by
clairvoyance or scrying) currently observing you, or that
begin to observe you during the duration. As an action,
you can focus on a sensor and force that spell’s caster to
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose
one of the following options:
The spell used to create the sensor ends.
You create a sensor and observe the caster as if you
successfully cast the scrying spell on them. If the caster
ceases concentration on their spell, you can choose to
maintain it as long as you concentrate on infinite mirror,
allowing both of you to continue observing through your
sensors as normal. You can use this option on only one
spell at a time, and you can end your observation on an
existing spell at any time.
A creature that succeeds on its saving throw can’t be
affected by this casting ofinfinite mirror.
INVESTITURE OF SHADOW
(HANDS OF DUSK)

Darkness suffuses your body for the duration, granting
you the following benefits.
• You have resistance to cold and necrotic damage.
• Your walking speed increases by 20, you gain a climb
speed equal to your new walking speed, you gain
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can
squeeze through a space as narrow as 1-inch wide.
• You can use your action to create a wave of darkness
that fills the area within 15 feet of you. Each creature
in the area must make a Constitution saving throw,

LIFE FADES (TOUCH OF TWILIGHT)
1st-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 15 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Make a melee spell attack against a creature that isn’t a
construct or undead within range. On a hit, the target takes
2d10 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion.
Exhaustion gained from this spell can’t exceed two levels.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10
for each slot level above first.
LIQUID NIGHT
Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a vial, bottle, bowl, or other
container to hold the ink)
Duration: Instantaneous
You cause the shadows to coalesce into a small quantity
of ink in an empty container you are holding. This creates
enough ink to write a page’s worth of text. It is not of
sufficient quality to be used for scribing spells. When you
cast the spell, you can decide if the ink behaves normally,
or if it glows a faint red in dim light or darkness. In the
latter case, the ink and anything written or drawn with it
sheds dim light out to 5 feet.
If you cast this spell again before the ink is used to write,
paint, stain, or dye something, the previous casting’s
worth of ink disappears.
NIGHTFIRE (SHADOWS SPREAD)
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (ash from a fire that was doused
rather than burning itself out)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
An eerie black and gray flame erupts from the ground in a
5-foot sphere centered on a point you can see. The flame
sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first
time on its turn, or starts its turn there, it must make a
Constitution saving throw. It takes 1d10 cold damage and
1d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much
of each on a successful one. In addition, the creature is
limned in ghostly flame until the start of its next tur
while so illuminated, the creature cannot benefit from
invisibility and has disadvantage on Stealth checks.
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you
can use an action to move the flame up to 60 feet in any
direction.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, either the cold or necrotic
damage increases by 1d10 for each slot above second.
OBSCURING SHADOWS
(TENEBROUS SHROUDS)
4th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 20 feet
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You wrap twisting shadows around up to six creatures
within range that you can see. All attack rolls against
a target obscured by this spell have disadvantage. An
attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on
sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as
with truesight.
PASS INTO SHADOW (EBON ROADS)
6th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an uncut jet or onyx worth at least 200 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in
a circle are transported to the Plane of Shadow. Other
than allowing passage to only that single plane, pass into
shadow otherwise functions as the spell plane shift.
POWER WORD FEAR (DREAD SOUL)
7th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
You speak a dread word of power that causes inescapable,
soul-deep panic to assail one creature you can see within
range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject
to overwhelming terror. Otherwise, the spell has no
effect. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being
frightened.
While the target is affected by this numbing terror, the
target must move before taking any other action each turn,
and it must move as far from you as possible. The target
also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws other than Wisdom saving throws. Finally,
if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell
slot or usage is wasted.
A target suffering this fear can make a Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
a success.
PRISON OF NIGHT (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)
6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (a rod of polished jet or onyx worth
at least 400 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create a 10-foot cube of opaque shadow centered on a
point you can see. The cube blocks line of sight.
When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely
inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially
within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area,
are pushed away from the center of the area until they are
completely outside the cube and must make a Constitution
saving throw, taking 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic
damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage
on a successful one.
As an action, a creature can attempt to push through the
shadowy walls by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics)
check against your spell save DC. A creature that touches
the cube takes 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage.
SCREEN (DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)
8th-level illusion
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours
You create an entire illusory scene, complete with sights,
sounds, scents, and even feel, which can be as large as
a 100-foot cube within range. Within that area, you can
make terrain and structures appear however you like. You
can create illusory creatures, who behave as you describe,
and you can decide whether real creatures, objects, or
structures are visible or invisible on an individual basis.
You set the descriptions and behavior of illusory
creatures, and cloak existing creatures when you cast the
spell and can’t change these decisions later. A creature
made invisible by this spell that makes an attack, damages
a creature, or forces a creature to make a saving throw
becomes visible. Each round on your turn, harmful
images created by the spell can deal 1d8 psychic damage
to up to six creatures interacting with them according to
the parameters you set. The creatures believe the damage
.
takes the form of whatever is appropriate; a wolf’s ripping
jaws, burns from lava, crushing boulders tumbling down
a cliff, etc.
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to
the area’s true form; but all other aspects of the illusion
remain, so creatures can still physically interact with the
illusion, which appears hazy and translucent to them.
Creatures, objects, or pieces of terrain created by the
illusion vanish if they leave the area.
SHADOW FORM (CLOAK OF SHADE)
3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a bit of smooth obsidian or dark glass)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You become a living shadow, appearing as a dark,
wavering silhouette of yourself. Equipment you are
wearing or carrying melds into your new form. You can’t
use or benefit from any equipment while a shadow.
While in this form, your walking speed is reduced by 10,
but you gain a climb speed equal to your reduced walking
speed. While in dim light or darkness you gain resistance
to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical
attacks; and gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution saving throws, as well as on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks. You gain vulnerability to radiant damage, and when
in bright light, attacks against you gain advantage. You
can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without
squeezing. If you fall, you do so slowly. You fall 60 feet per
round and take no falling damage.
While in this form, you can’t make weapon attacks, cast
spells, or manipulate objects or creatures. You can speak,
but only in a rough whisper.
For the duration, you can make a special draining attack
as an action. Make a melee spell attack with a reach of 15
feet. If you hit, the target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6
necrotic damage.
SHADOW OUT OF TIME
(SHADOW’S EMBRACE)
9th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds
You transport yourself and any equipment you are wearing
or carrying to an isolated pocket of the Plane of Shadow
where time moves faster. This pocket is a cylindrical space
20 feet wide and 20 feet high. It is blank and featureless,
save for a small planar window that shows the area you
just left. The window allows observation only; you can’t
interact in any way through the window, and the window
is invisible from the other side. During each turn you take
in the pocket, you can take three turns worth of actions.
Creatures observed through the window appear to move
in slow motion.
While in the shadow pocket, you can only affect yourself
and objects you brought with you. You can end the spell
early as an action. When the spell ends, you reappear
on the Material Plane in an unoccupied space anywhere
within 1,000 feet of the spot where you cast the spell.
SHADOW PUPPETS (HANDS OF DUSK)
5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You summon a broad swathe of coiling, grasping shadows.
Choose a point you can see within range; the shadows
occupy a 30-foot-radius sphere from that point. Until the
spell ends, that area is difficult terrain for your enemies.
At the start of each of your turns, each enemy within
10 feet of a light source within the radius must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d12 cold damage
if the light source is a fire or otherwise radiates heat, or
2d12 necrotic damage if the light source is magical or
otherwise radiates no heat.
At the start of your turn, choose one creature within the
area. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or be knocked prone and grappled by the shadows.
The creature can use its action to make a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your
spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can
command the shadows to lash out against one creature
within the area. The target must make a Dexterity saving
throw, taking 3d8 cold damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
SHROUD OF NIGHTMARE
(CLOAK OF SHADE)
2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
You touch a willing creature, surrounding it with a flickering
aura of shade. For the duration, when the target makes an
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it can
roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. A
creature that forces the target to make one of those saving
throws immediately takes 2d8 psychic damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8
for each slot level above 2nd, to a maximum of 4d8.
SPELL ECHO (ARCANA UNBOUND)
6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet, and see text
Components: V, S
Duration: Special; see text
Choose any spell of 4th-level or lower, with a casting time
of 1 action or less, that was cast by another creature within
range since the end of your last turn. You must have been
able to see the caster and any effect of the spell itself.
You immediately duplicate that spell, targeting it as you
choose, and using your own abilities, and spell save DC.
It follows all the normal rules of range, targeting, school,
duration, concentration, and so forth, though you are not
required to provide any material components.
At Higher Level. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 7th level or higher, you can duplicate a spell of one
level higher than fourth for each slot level above 6th.
SPELL TURNING (THE WEAVE UNMADE)
7th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a small mirror worth at least 100
gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Up to 1 hour
A murky aura surrounds you, reflecting certain spells
back at the caster. Only spells that specifically target you
are affected; spells that affect an area which happens to
include you are not.
Roll 1d4+6 when you cast this spell; this is the total
number of spell levels the aura can reflect. When you are
targeted by a spell, it instead affects the caster as though
they were the target, and you subtract the spell’s level
from the number of levels remaining. When you run out
of levels remaining, the spell ends.
If you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the
levels remaining to your spell turning, you may suffer
only a partial effect, or reflect only a partial effect. If the
levels remaining to your spell turning equal half or less
than half of the spell’s level, you suffer a partial effect; if
the levels remaining are greater than half the spell’s level,
the caster suffers a partial effect.
When someone suffers a spell’s partial effect, they have
advantage on any applicable saves, take only half of any
damage, and the spell’s maximum duration is halved.
If both you and the caster are under the effect of spell
turning, you both subtract half the spell’s level from your
remaining total and are both subject to a partial effect as
described above.
SPIRIT GUARDIANS
(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)
When you cast spirit guardians, as a shadowcaster spell,
the spirits appear as featureless, shadowy silhouettes, and
deal necrotic damage, regardless of your alignment.
Storm of Vengeance (The Shadow Bleeds)
When you cast storm of vengeance as a shadowcaster
spell, the rain in round two is shadow hail, dealing your
choice of cold or necrotic damage rather than acid damage
as per normal.
TWILIGHT TENDRIL
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 20 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A tendril of shadow lashes out at one creature you can
see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength
saving throw or be moved 10 feet in any direction you
choose, and then take 1d6 points of cold damage.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
UMBRAL DOPPELGANGER
(BORN OF NIGHT)
8th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You send one creature that you can see within range to
a pocket of the Plane of Shadow, while simultaneously
summoning a shadowy duplicate of that creature to act
on your behalf. The target must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a success, the target is not banished, and the
duplicate appears in the nearest unoccupied space within
5 feet of the target and disappears at the end of its own
turn. On a failed save, the target disappears, reappearing
in the Plane of Shadow, while the duplicate appears in the
space the target vacated. While in the Plane of Shadow,
the target is incapacitated.
When it first appears, the duplicate is statistically
identical to the target except for the following distinctions:
The duplicate has resistance to cold and necrotic
damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage.
• All damage caused by the duplicate is either cold
or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the
spell), rather than the standard type caused by its
weapons, spells, or other features.
• The duplicate can only cast spells/duplicate spell
effects up to 6th level, whether on its own or via
magic items, even if the original creature can cast or
create higher-level magics.
• Any of the duplicate’s equipment that is removed or
dropped disappears at the start of the duplicate’s next turn,
unless the duplicate takes possession of it before then.
The duplicate acts on the target creature’s initiative,
losing all ties, and is friendly to you and your companions
for the duration. It obeys any verbal commands that you
issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue
any commands to the duplicate, it defends itself from
hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
The banished creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns. On a success, or when the spell ends,
it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied
space if that space is occupied. If the target returns before
the spell ends, the duplicate disappears at the end of its next
turn and the spell ends. The target and the duplicate have
advantage on attack rolls against one another.
UMBRAL FORM (SHADOW’S EMBRACE)
7th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours
You step into the dimensional overlap between the
Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow. With the
exception of involving the Plane of Shadow instead of the
Ethereal Plane, this otherwise functions in all respect as
the spell etherealness.
UMBRAL HORDE (BORN OF NIGHT)
9th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/2 rounds; see text
Choose up to five creatures within range; each target
must attempt a Constitution save. On a failure, a target is
banished to the Plane of Shadow and replaced by a dark
duplicate, as per umbral doppelganger. On a success,
the target is not banished, but the duplicate still appears
adjacent to them.
The duplicates act as a group, immediately after you
in the initiative order. If a target succeeded on its saving
throw, that target’s duplicate vanishes at the end of its turn
Targets sent to the Plane of Shadow are incapacitated
and return at the end of your next turn. Their duplicates
then disappear at the end of their own next turn.
The duplicates function in all ways as described in
umbral doppelganger.
UMBRAL TOOL (FORGED OF NIGHT)
1st-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You summon a tool made of shadow into your free hand.
This can be any mundane, simple tool: a hammer, a
crowbar, a chisel, a saw, and so forth. It functions exactly
like the real thing in all respects, and you can even pass it
off to a companion for their own use.
Alternatively, you can create a simple, one-handed
weapon instead of a tool. It doesn’t count as magical for
overcoming resistance or immunity to damage.
The items created by this spell are somewhat rough and
lacking in detail, so if you use it to duplicate tools that
require precision—such as thieves’ tools or calligrapher’s
tools—you have disadvantage on checks made while
using them.
VAMPIRIC WALL (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)
5th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a few bloodstained black or gray
threads)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you
choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you
choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free
floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up
to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall is
opaque, but creatures and objects can pass through it.
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
takes 4d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a
successful save. Choose one creature that took damage
from the wall. You regain a number of hit points equal to
half the necrotic damage taken by that creature.
When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time
on a turn, or ends its turn there, it takes 4d8 necrotic
damage. You regain hit points equal to half the amount of
necrotic damage dealt.
Each time the wall deals necrotic damage due to a
creature entering its area or ending a turn there, the length
of the wall is reduced by 5 feet. If the length reaches 0,
the spell ends.
VENGEFUL SHADE
Necromancy cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, M (a weapon)
Duration: 1 round
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make
an attack with a weapon against one creature within the
spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target
suffers the attack’s normal effects, and is surrounded by
dancing, writhing ribbons of shadow until the start of your
next turn. If, before that time, the creature targets you with
an attack or spell, or ends its movement closer to you than
when it started, it immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage
and the spell ends.
This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher
levels. At 5th level, the weapon attack deals an extra
1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the
target takes for targeting or closing on you increases
to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level
and 17th level.
WINDOWS OF SHADE
(SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)
3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of coal dust)
Duration: Up to 1 hour
You gain the ability to see normally in darkness, even
magical darkness, out to 60 feet.
At any point during the duration, you can spend a
bonus action to end the spell and make a gaze attack
against any living creature you can see, and that can
see you, within 60 feet. The target takes 1d8 cold
damage and 1d8 necrotic damage and must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of
you. While frightened by this spell, a creature must
take the Dash action and move away from you by the
safest available route on each of its turns, unless there
is nowhere to move. The creature can attempt a new
saving throw at the end of each of its turns; if it can’t
see you, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On
a successful save, the effect ends
shadow eLeMentaL
The incarnated life forces of earth, air, fire, and water
that exist on the elemental planes, that become traditional
elementals when summoned to the Material World, have
their own dark reflections on the Plane of Shadows.
Initially mindless echoes, literal shadows, they eventually
developed rudimentary awareness of their own. These
have become so-called shadow elementals, entities of
living shade, formed from the stuff of the Plane of Shadow.
Nebulous Form. Unlike true elementals, shadow
elementals maintain a semi-physical form at all times,
even when unsummoned and freely roaming the Plane
of Shadow. This form is constantly shifting, ranging
from a blot of darkness all but invisible in the gloom
of their home realm, to looming, almost-but-not-quite
humanoid silhouettes. Even in the brightest illumination,
which shadow elementals find deeply unpleasant, their
boundaries are inky and indistinct, like a haze or a dark
watercolor painting.
Loathing of Light and Life. Both the gleam of excess light
and the warmth of living beings bring shadow elementals
pain, and thus they lash out and seek to destroy the source
of their discomfort. Like true elementals, they resent being
summoned and forced into servitude, but they possess a
hostility beyond even the capricious and often destructive
instincts of more natural spirits. This doesn’t make them
more difficult to control, but shadow elementals do tend
toward more of what mortal beings would consider evil
behaviors when free to act as they please.
Alone in the Dark. Shadow elementals are solitary entities.
They aren’t hostile toward one another, but neither do
they seek to congregate; if two or more find themselves in
the same vicinity, they tend to simply ignore one another.
While they show some understanding of all the various
elemental languages, as well as the commands of any who
summon them regardless of language, they appear to have
no tongue of their own. If they are capable of speech or
communication at all, no one has ever observed it.
Elemental Nature. A shadow elemental doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.

Light Sensitivity. While in bright light, the elemental
has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.
Shadow Form. The elemental can enter a hostile
creature’s space and stop there. It can move through
a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the
elemental can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
Multiattack. The elemental makes two touch attacks.
Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 7 (1d8+3) cold damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.
Frigid Void (Recharge 4-6). Each creature in the
elemental’s space must make a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw. On a successful save, the target’s speed
is reduced to half until the start of the elemental’s next
turn. On a failure, the target is coated in a layer of
shadowy frost. As long as the frost lasts, the target’s
speed is reduced to half and it takes 2 (1d4) cold
damage and 2 (1d4) necrotic damage at the start of
each of its turns. The target can attempt a new saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on a success. The effect also ends if the target takes 10
points of fire or radiant damage from a single source.
If the initial saving throw is successful, the target’s
speed is reduced to half until the start of the elemental’s
next turn.
