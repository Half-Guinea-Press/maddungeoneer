<h1 id="shadowcaster-spell-descriptions">Shadowcaster Spell Descriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#shadowcaster-spell-descriptions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Note that most shadowcaster spells clearly have an element of darkness to them, even if the spell normally would not. Weather effects include unnaturally inky clouds and streams of shadow amidst the precipitation, for instance, while physical objects they create or summon are murky of hue and shot through with inky, fluctuating veins. Only those spells whose effectiveness would be compromised by such obvious effects, such as illusions, lack these traits.</p>
<p>ARROW OF DUSK</p>
<p>Evocation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You launch a bolt of inky darkness at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 points of cold damage and has disadvantage on the next Strength or Dexterity check it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>A living creature reduced to 0 hit points by arrow of dusk falls unconscious and is stable, rather than dying or making death saves.</p>
<p>The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level (2d8), 11<sup>th</sup> level (3d8), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (4d8).</p>
<p>BEND PERSPECTIVE (VISIONS AND VEILS)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level divination</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 30 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small prism)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Choose a point you can see within range. You create an invisible magical sensor at that spot. You see through the sensor as though you were at that spot. Creatures that can see invisible objects see an eyeball in shades of black and gray.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can switch your viewpoint to your true position or back to the sensor. If you make an ability check, attack roll or saving throw that relies on Strength or Dexterity while your perspective occupies the sensor, you do so with disadvantage.</p>
<p>As an action, you can move the sensor up to 15 feet to another point within range. If you move farther than 30 feet from the sensor, the spell ends.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>BLACK CANDLE</p>
<p>Illusion cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, M (a candle wick or a bit of wax)</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a tiny mote of illumination on an object that is no larger than 5 feet in any dimension. The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 5 feet beyond that. Choose up to five creatures when you cast this spell. Only you and the chosen creatures can see or benefit from the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.</p>
<p>If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p>
<p>CARPET OF SHADOW (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A thick layer of darkness coats the ground in a 15-foot radius from a point you can see within range. For the duration, the affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the semisolid shadow until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the spell can use its action to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC. On a success it frees itself.</p>
<p>Shadowcasters using the Touch of Darkness Mystery are immune to all effects of this spell.</p>
<p>CONJURE UMBRAL SERVANT</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 minute</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (coal dust and crushed onyx)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You call forth a shadow elemental to serve you. In all other respects, this spell is identical to conjure elemental.</p>
<p>CONTROL WEATHER (THE SHADOW BLEEDS)</p>
<p>When casting control weather as a shadowcaster spell, you cannot raise the temperature to hotter than “cool,” and you cannot reduce precipitation to less than “overcast or ground fog.” Otherwise, the spell functions as normal.</p>
<p>CURTAIN OF GLOOM (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a few black or gray threads)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you can see within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 40 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall is opaque, and its area is heavily obscured by magical darkness.</p>
<p>Passing through the wall is particularly disorienting. Each time a creature enters the wall or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the rest of the creature’s movement is in the opposite direction the creature intended. Creatures that do not rely on sight, can see in magical darkness, or are native to the Plane of Shadow are immune to this effect of the wall.</p>
<p>DANCING SHROUD (WRITHING GLOOM)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a short length of black rope or cord)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You summon wisps and tendrils of semisolid shadow in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within range. The shadows are difficult terrain and can impede up to six creatures of your choice that you can see. When the spell is cast and when a chosen creature starts its turn in the area, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p>
<p>On a failed save, the creature is restrained. If a creature restrained in this way attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the spell fails, and the spell slot or usage is lost. It can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.</p>
<p>DOUSE</p>
<p>Transmutation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous, or up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You infuse the light before you with shade. All nonmagical light sources the size of a campfire or smaller in a 60-foot cube originating from you are affected. Choose one of the following options: Affected light sources now shed dim light out to the range they normally shed bright light for 1 hour. Creatures have resistance to any fire damage shed by affected light sources. You can extinguish one light source in the area, causing it to shed no light. If the light source was fire, the fire goes out. If the sources were some other form of nonmagical light such as luminous fungi, they are extinguished for 1 hour. As a bonus action, you can end the effects of the spell (extinguished flames don’t reignite). Small or larger creatures who produce nonmagical light are immune to this spell.</p>
<p>DUSK AND DAWN (SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self (30-foot radius)</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You can raise or lower the ambient light within range by one “step”—changing bright light or darkness to dim light, or changing dim light to bright light or darkness. At any time during the duration, you can spend an action to change the level again (though you can never change it to two “steps” beyond its ambient level).</p>
<p>Darkvision and magical light function normally in dim light and darkness created by this spell. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the radius of the effect increases by 15 feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>ECLIPSE ARCANE (THE WEAVE UNMADE) 9<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self (60-foot radius)</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>All ongoing spells of 7<sup>th</sup> level or lower within the radius are automatically dispelled, as per dispel magic. For each spell of 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> level in the area, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends. When casting eclipse arcane, you can choose to exclude any spell effects currently affecting you or objects in your possession.</p>
<p>ELDRITCH TWILIGHT (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>Shadowy tendrils intertwined with threads of magic expand in a 20-foot sphere from a point you can see within range. The area becomes dim light for the duration. The mystic shadows interfere with spellcasting. A creature within the area that attempts to cast a spell, or a creature outside the area that casts a spell targeting anything in the area, must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. Targets proficient in the Arcana skill can add their proficiency bonus to the roll, even if their spellcasting ability is not Intelligence. On a failure, the spell fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted. Shadowcasters who are outside the spell’s area can cast their spells into the area normally.</p>
<p>EPHEMERAL IMAGE</p>
<p>(DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 1,000 miles</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours</p>
<p>You create a duplicate of yourself, made up semisolid shadow, anywhere within range that you can see or have seen before. This functions identically to the spell project image, with the following alterations:
- Because the illusion is semisolid, mild physical interaction with it does not reveal it to be an illusion. A successful attack, or a creature that uses its action to physically examine the image and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC reveals the image’s true nature.
- The image can manipulate small objects, as per the mage hand spell.
- You can cast spells of 5<sup>th</sup> level or lower through the image, as though you occupied its space.
- The illusion can fly at its normal speed (twice your walking speed). If you restrict its movement in a given round to half that speed, you can cause it to move as a bonus action rather than a normal action.
- If the illusion takes damage, you can make a Constitution saving throw as if you took the damage dealt to the image. If you succeed, the illusion doesn’t disappear.</p>
<p>EPHEMERAL STORM</p>
<p>(THE SHADOW BLEEDS)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 200 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A tumult of slicing shadows and white lightning crash down from the heavens in a 15-foot radius around a point you can see within range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 lightning damage and 5d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to be unaffected by it.</p>
<p>FAR SIGHT (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup>-level divination</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a mirror or reflective ball made of polished obsidian, worth at least 1,500 gp)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>This spell functions as scrying, but you also gain the benefits ofcomprehend languages, detect magic, and true seeing through the sensor.</p>
<p>FLAME BLADE (FORGED OF NIGHT)</p>
<p>When you cast flame blade as a shadowcaster spell, the blade created is a twisting saber life-draining gloom. The spell deals necrotic damage.</p>
<p>FLICKERING MOTES</p>
<p>Evocation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Up to 8 hours</p>
<p>Choose one creature within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is beset with tiny shadows at the corner of its vision. The target has disadvantage on the next Intelligence or Wisdom check it makes, or on its passive Perception against the next Dexterity (Stealth) check made to hide from it. The spell then ends.</p>
<p>The spell ends if you cast it again.</p>
<p>HELLISH REBUKE</p>
<p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p>
<p>When you cast hellish rebuke as a shadowcaster spell, the spell causes the target to writhe in frigid shadows. The spell deals your choice of cold or necrotic damage.</p>
<p>HYPNOTIC SHADE (WRITHING GLOOM)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror, polished coin, or other means of creating a flickering light)</p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>A writhing, shifting pattern of shadow appears at a point you can see within range. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 30 feet of the chosen point, and who can see it, are affected in ascending order of their current hit points. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is charmed until the spell ends. A creature charmed in this way is paralyzed. The charmed condition ends if the creature takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature out of its stupor. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot above first.</p>
<p>IMPRISONMENT (WORLDS APART)</p>
<p>When you cast imprisonment as a shadowcaster spell, you</p>
<p>must select either the “burial” or “hedged prison” options.</p>
<p>INFINITE MIRROR (DISTANT REFLECTIONS)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level divination</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror or prism)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to ten minutes</p>
<p>You instantly become aware of and can see any magical sensors (such as arcane eye, or those created by clairvoyance or scrying) currently observing you, or that begin to observe you during the duration. As an action, you can focus on a sensor and force that spell’s caster to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose one of the following options:</p>
<p>The spell used to create the sensor ends.</p>
<p>You create a sensor and observe the caster as if you successfully cast the scrying spell on them. If the caster ceases concentration on their spell, you can choose to maintain it as long as you concentrate on infinite mirror, allowing both of you to continue observing through your sensors as normal. You can use this option on only one spell at a time, and you can end your observation on an existing spell at any time.</p>
<p>A creature that succeeds on its saving throw can’t be affected by this casting ofinfinite mirror.</p>
<p>INVESTITURE OF SHADOW</p>
<p>(HANDS OF DUSK)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Darkness suffuses your body for the duration, granting you the following benefits.
- You have resistance to cold and necrotic damage.
- Your walking speed increases by 20, you gain a climb speed equal to your new walking speed, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1-inch wide.
- You can use your action to create a wave of darkness that fills the area within 15 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 cold and 2d8 necrotic damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not blinded on a successful one.</p>
<p>LIFE FADES (TOUCH OF TWILIGHT)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level necromancy</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 15 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature that isn’t a construct or undead within range. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from this spell can’t exceed two levels. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above first.</p>
<p>LIQUID NIGHT</p>
<p>Conjuration cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a vial, bottle, bowl, or other container to hold the ink)</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You cause the shadows to coalesce into a small quantity of ink in an empty container you are holding. This creates enough ink to write a page’s worth of text. It is not of sufficient quality to be used for scribing spells. When you cast the spell, you can decide if the ink behaves normally, or if it glows a faint red in dim light or darkness. In the latter case, the ink and anything written or drawn with it sheds dim light out to 5 feet.</p>
<p>If you cast this spell again before the ink is used to write, paint, stain, or dye something, the previous casting’s worth of ink disappears.</p>
<p>NIGHTFIRE (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (ash from a fire that was doused rather than burning itself out)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>An eerie black and gray flame erupts from the ground in a 5-foot sphere centered on a point you can see. The flame sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>
<p>When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on its turn, or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 1d10 cold damage and 1d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much of each on a successful one. In addition, the creature is limned in ghostly flame until the start of its next tur while so illuminated, the creature cannot benefit from invisibility and has disadvantage on Stealth checks. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the flame up to 60 feet in any direction.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, either the cold or necrotic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot above second.</p>
<p>OBSCURING SHADOWS</p>
<p>(TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 20 feet</p>
<p>Components: V</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You wrap twisting shadows around up to six creatures within range that you can see. All attack rolls against a target obscured by this spell have disadvantage. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p>
<p>PASS INTO SHADOW (EBON ROADS)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (an uncut jet or onyx worth at least 200 gp)</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to the Plane of Shadow. Other than allowing passage to only that single plane, pass into shadow otherwise functions as the spell plane shift.</p>
<p>POWER WORD FEAR (DREAD SOUL)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level enchantment</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You speak a dread word of power that causes inescapable, soul-deep panic to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to overwhelming terror. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being frightened.</p>
<p>While the target is affected by this numbing terror, the target must move before taking any other action each turn, and it must move as far from you as possible. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws other than Wisdom saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted.</p>
<p>A target suffering this fear can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p>PRISON OF NIGHT (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 100 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a rod of polished jet or onyx worth at least 400 gp)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a 10-foot cube of opaque shadow centered on a point you can see. The cube blocks line of sight. When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the cube and must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>As an action, a creature can attempt to push through the shadowy walls by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. A creature that touches the cube takes 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage.</p>
<p>SCREEN (DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 24 hours</p>
<p>You create an entire illusory scene, complete with sights, sounds, scents, and even feel, which can be as large as a 100-foot cube within range. Within that area, you can make terrain and structures appear however you like. You can create illusory creatures, who behave as you describe, and you can decide whether real creatures, objects, or structures are visible or invisible on an individual basis. You set the descriptions and behavior of illusory creatures, and cloak existing creatures when you cast the spell and can’t change these decisions later. A creature made invisible by this spell that makes an attack, damages a creature, or forces a creature to make a saving throw becomes visible. Each round on your turn, harmful images created by the spell can deal 1d8 psychic damage to up to six creatures interacting with them according to the parameters you set. The creatures believe the damage takes the form of whatever is appropriate; a wolf’s ripping jaws, burns from lava, crushing boulders tumbling down a cliff, etc.</p>
<p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the area’s true form; but all other aspects of the illusion remain, so creatures can still physically interact with the illusion, which appears hazy and translucent to them. Creatures, objects, or pieces of terrain created by the illusion vanish if they leave the area.</p>
<p>SHADOW FORM (CLOAK OF SHADE)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a bit of smooth obsidian or dark glass)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You become a living shadow, appearing as a dark, wavering silhouette of yourself. Equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form. You can’t use or benefit from any equipment while a shadow. While in this form, your walking speed is reduced by 10, but you gain a climb speed equal to your reduced walking speed. While in dim light or darkness you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks; and gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, as well as on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You gain vulnerability to radiant damage, and when in bright light, attacks against you gain advantage. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If you fall, you do so slowly. You fall 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</p>
<p>While in this form, you can’t make weapon attacks, cast spells, or manipulate objects or creatures. You can speak, but only in a rough whisper.</p>
<p>For the duration, you can make a special draining attack as an action. Make a melee spell attack with a reach of 15 feet. If you hit, the target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 necrotic damage.</p>
<p>SHADOW OUT OF TIME</p>
<p>(SHADOW’S EMBRACE)</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 3 rounds</p>
<p>You transport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying to an isolated pocket of the Plane of Shadow where time moves faster. This pocket is a cylindrical space 20 feet wide and 20 feet high. It is blank and featureless, save for a small planar window that shows the area you just left. The window allows observation only; you can’t interact in any way through the window, and the window is invisible from the other side. During each turn you take in the pocket, you can take three turns worth of actions. Creatures observed through the window appear to move in slow motion.</p>
<p>While in the shadow pocket, you can only affect yourself and objects you brought with you. You can end the spell early as an action. When the spell ends, you reappear on the Material Plane in an unoccupied space anywhere within 1,000 feet of the spot where you cast the spell.</p>
<p>SHADOW PUPPETS (HANDS OF DUSK)</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You summon a broad swathe of coiling, grasping shadows. Choose a point you can see within range; the shadows occupy a 30-foot-radius sphere from that point. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain for your enemies. At the start of each of your turns, each enemy within 10 feet of a light source within the radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d12 cold damage if the light source is a fire or otherwise radiates heat, or 2d12 necrotic damage if the light source is magical or otherwise radiates no heat.</p>
<p>At the start of your turn, choose one creature within the area. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled by the shadows. The creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can command the shadows to lash out against one creature within the area. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 cold damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>SHROUD OF NIGHTMARE</p>
<p>(CLOAK OF SHADE)</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 10 minutes</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature, surrounding it with a flickering aura of shade. For the duration, when the target makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. A creature that forces the target to make one of those saving throws immediately takes 2d8 psychic damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2<sup>nd</sup>, to a maximum of 4d8.</p>
<p>SPELL ECHO (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet, and see text</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Special; see text</p>
<p>Choose any spell of 4<sup>th</sup>-level or lower, with a casting time of 1 action or less, that was cast by another creature within range since the end of your last turn. You must have been able to see the caster and any effect of the spell itself. You immediately duplicate that spell, targeting it as you choose, and using your own abilities, and spell save DC. It follows all the normal rules of range, targeting, school, duration, concentration, and so forth, though you are not required to provide any material components.</p>
<p>At Higher Level. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you can duplicate a spell of one level higher than fourth for each slot level above 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>SPELL TURNING (THE WEAVE UNMADE)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A murky aura surrounds you, reflecting certain spells back at the caster. Only spells that specifically target you are affected; spells that affect an area which happens to include you are not.</p>
<p>Roll 1d4+6 when you cast this spell; this is the total number of spell levels the aura can reflect. When you are targeted by a spell, it instead affects the caster as though they were the target, and you subtract the spell’s level from the number of levels remaining. When you run out of levels remaining, the spell ends.</p>
<p>If you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the levels remaining to your spell turning, you may suffer only a partial effect, or reflect only a partial effect. If the levels remaining to your spell turning equal half or less than half of the spell’s level, you suffer a partial effect; if the levels remaining are greater than half the spell’s level, the caster suffers a partial effect.</p>
<p>When someone suffers a spell’s partial effect, they have advantage on any applicable saves, take only half of any damage, and the spell’s maximum duration is halved. If both you and the caster are under the effect of spell turning, you both subtract half the spell’s level from your remaining total and are both subject to a partial effect as described above.</p>
<p>SPIRIT GUARDIANS</p>
<p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p>
<p>When you cast spirit guardians, as a shadowcaster spell, the spirits appear as featureless, shadowy silhouettes, and deal necrotic damage, regardless of your alignment.</p>
<p>Storm of Vengeance (The Shadow Bleeds)</p>
<p>When you cast storm of vengeance as a shadowcaster spell, the rain in round two is shadow hail, dealing your choice of cold or necrotic damage rather than acid damage as per normal.</p>
<p>TWILIGHT TENDRIL</p>
<p>Evocation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 20 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A tendril of shadow lashes out at one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved 10 feet in any direction you choose, and then take 1d6 points of cold damage.</p>
<p>This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level (2d6), 11<sup>th</sup> level (3d6), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (4d6).</p>
<p>UMBRAL DOPPELGANGER</p>
<p>(BORN OF NIGHT)</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You send one creature that you can see within range to a pocket of the Plane of Shadow, while simultaneously summoning a shadowy duplicate of that creature to act on your behalf. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the target is not banished, and the duplicate appears in the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target and disappears at the end of its own turn. On a failed save, the target disappears, reappearing in the Plane of Shadow, while the duplicate appears in the space the target vacated. While in the Plane of Shadow, the target is incapacitated.</p>
<p>When it first appears, the duplicate is statistically identical to the target except for the following distinctions: The duplicate has resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage.
- All damage caused by the duplicate is either cold or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the spell), rather than the standard type caused by its weapons, spells, or other features.
- The duplicate can only cast spells/duplicate spell effects up to 6<sup>th</sup> level, whether on its own or via magic items, even if the original creature can cast or create higher-level magics.
- Any of the duplicate’s equipment that is removed or dropped disappears at the start of the duplicate’s next turn, unless the duplicate takes possession of it before then. The duplicate acts on the target creature’s initiative, losing all ties, and is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the duplicate, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p>
<p>The banished creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, or when the spell ends, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target returns before the spell ends, the duplicate disappears at the end of its next turn and the spell ends. The target and the duplicate have advantage on attack rolls against one another.</p>
<p>UMBRAL FORM (SHADOW’S EMBRACE)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 8 hours</p>
<p>You step into the dimensional overlap between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow. With the exception of involving the Plane of Shadow instead of the Ethereal Plane, this otherwise functions in all respect as the spell etherealness.</p>
<p>UMBRAL HORDE (BORN OF NIGHT)</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/2 rounds; see text</p>
<p>Choose up to five creatures within range; each target must attempt a Constitution save. On a failure, a target is banished to the Plane of Shadow and replaced by a dark duplicate, as per umbral doppelganger. On a success, the target is not banished, but the duplicate still appears adjacent to them.</p>
<p>The duplicates act as a group, immediately after you in the initiative order. If a target succeeded on its saving throw, that target’s duplicate vanishes at the end of its turn Targets sent to the Plane of Shadow are incapacitated and return at the end of your next turn. Their duplicates then disappear at the end of their own next turn. The duplicates function in all ways as described in umbral doppelganger.</p>
<p>UMBRAL TOOL (FORGED OF NIGHT)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You summon a tool made of shadow into your free hand. This can be any mundane, simple tool: a hammer, a crowbar, a chisel, a saw, and so forth. It functions exactly like the real thing in all respects, and you can even pass it off to a companion for their own use.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a simple, one-handed weapon instead of a tool. It doesn’t count as magical for overcoming resistance or immunity to damage.</p>
<p>The items created by this spell are somewhat rough and lacking in detail, so if you use it to duplicate tools that require precision—such as thieves’ tools or calligrapher’s tools—you have disadvantage on checks made while using them.</p>
<p>VAMPIRIC WALL (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level necromancy</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a few bloodstained black or gray threads)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall is opaque, but creatures and objects can pass through it. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Choose one creature that took damage from the wall. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage taken by that creature. When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn, or ends its turn there, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</p>
<p>Each time the wall deals necrotic damage due to a creature entering its area or ending a turn there, the length of the wall is reduced by 5 feet. If the length reaches 0, the spell ends.</p>
<p>VENGEFUL SHADE</p>
<p>Necromancy cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 30 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, M (a weapon)</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and is surrounded by dancing, writhing ribbons of shadow until the start of your next turn. If, before that time, the creature targets you with an attack or spell, or ends its movement closer to you than when it started, it immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage and the spell ends.</p>
<p>This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5<sup>th</sup> level, the weapon attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for targeting or closing on you increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11<sup>th</sup> level and 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>WINDOWS OF SHADE</p>
<p>(SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a pinch of coal dust)</p>
<p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You gain the ability to see normally in darkness, even magical darkness, out to 60 feet.</p>
<p>At any point during the duration, you can spend a bonus action to end the spell and make a gaze attack against any living creature you can see, and that can see you, within 60 feet. The target takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. The creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns; if it can’t see you, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the effect ends</p>
