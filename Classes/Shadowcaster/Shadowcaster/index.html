<h1 id="shadow-caster">Shadow Caster<a class="headerlink" href="#shadow-caster" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="shadow-magic">Shadow Magic<a class="headerlink" href="#shadow-magic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Before time, before light, before life… there was darkness. Even now, that darkness waits beyond the edge of all things, in the void beyond worlds and mortals and gods. Eventually, even the brightest of lights and the greatest of stars must dim and gutter, the longest day must yield to twilight. Darkness underlies all reality, and shadow is the only eternity.</p>
<p>Many fail to understand this, claiming darkness is but an absence, the lack of light. They don’t understand that, as the underpinnings of all existence, shadow possesses a primal power. This is especially true of magic, the heart of which is symbolism and symmetry. If shadow lies beneath the magic, is intertwined through it, then shadow is magic—and potentially the greatest form of it. By learning the secrets of natural darkness, emotional darkness, even otherworldly darkness as manifested by the Plane of Shadow, those rare few who have skirted the edges of understanding, who have just begun to grasp at these fundamental truths, can draw upon the power of shadow and void itself. Thus far, these have proved the equal of other forms of magic—no weaker, but no greater—but then, even the most studied and strong-willed have only begun to scratch the surface.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadowcaster">The Shadowcaster<a class="headerlink" href="#the-shadowcaster" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Asphere of pitch darkness hovers in the midst of a brightly lit chamber. Within sits a gaunt human woman, head thrown back and eyes wide, absorbing power from the inky shadows surrounding her. Retreating in horror from the illusion of a twisted monstrosity phasing through the stone wall, a castle guard is oblivious to the gnome materializing from the shadows behind him, hands raised to drain the warmth of life from his body.</p>
<p>A white-eyed elf steps from within the bounds of a dark and twisted storm, leaving a trail of unnatural devastation in her wake. Before anyone can even think to intercept her, she vanishes into the Plane of Shadow in a swirling puff of gloom.</p>
<p>Shadowcasters represent those rare few who have come to understand that night and shadow are a fundamental source of power, and who possess minds strong and flexible enough to master the arcane formulae and incantations required to draw on even the slightest traces of that power. As obsessive seekers of secret truths, and as masters—and, some would say, servants—of darkness, they are a fearful breed. Even good-aligned shadowcasters know to be careful of how openly they proclaim their nature and their passions, for few outside their ranks, few who do not understand the so-called Doctrine of Shadow, are inclined to trust them.</p>
<h2 id="the-doctrine-of-shadow">The Doctrine Of Shadow<a class="headerlink" href="#the-doctrine-of-shadow" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The theories described at the heart of shadow magic— that darkness underlies all things, that it is the only true infinity, the most primal of all powers—are known by those rare scholars who study them as the Doctrine of Shadow. It is this that all shadowcasters, whether deliberately or piecemeal, in groups or alone, formally or through the accidental unearthing of ancient knowledge, seek to understand.</p>
<p>Shadowcasters require minds capable of mastering the most complex of equations, while simultaneously holding onto the most mystifying or even maddening scraps of larger truths. Some seek power for their own ends, but all seek understanding, are willing to dismiss accepted arcane theories, to risk ostracism and even parts of their own sanity, to comprehend everything the Doctrine has to teach, and to fill in even a fraction of the many gaps in mortal understanding of shadow.</p>
<p>Some of the magics one can master through the Doctrine resemble spells known to other casters, simply approached from a different angle. Others, however, are incantations entirely unique to shadowcasters, and some—known as the Mysteries of Shadow—represent fundamental changes to the caster’s own nature or access to even greater magics.</p>
<p>Drawing as they all do on darkness, the Plane of Shadow, and similar sources, the magics of the shadowcaster are thematically narrower than those of some other magic users—though less so than the uninitiated might expect. Most shadowcasters believe, however, that as they and their brethren gain a greater understanding of primal darkness, as the Doctrine of Shadow continues to expand, both the sort and the strength of magics they can access will grow.</p>
<h2 id="secrets-and-lore">Secrets and Lore<a class="headerlink" href="#secrets-and-lore" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>All shadowcasters seek a greater understanding of magic and the nature of reality in general, and of shadow in particular. This alone is enough to make them appear strange or even downright alien to most others, and that’s before one considers the personal goals and ambitions of any shadowcaster. Between that and suspicions levied against their source of power, they are often forced into a measure of solitude. Anyone able to assist them in delving deeper into their studies, however, or simply offering companionship and alliance, once proven trustworthy, finds shadowcasters to be eager associates.</p>
<p>They are particularly eager to interact and trade secrets with warlocks, whose reputations are often as questionable as the shadowcasters’ own, and whose own pact magics bear some superficial resemblances to shadow magic. Similarly, they enjoy discussing arcane lore with the more mistrusted and solitary of wizards, such as necromancers. Any delve, adventure, or study is a potential source of learning for a shadowcaster, and they often find the most minuscule or obscure details fascinating. They thirst for understanding, and consider the loss of new lore far worse than the failure to acquire a treasure or to accomplish a particular goal.</p>
<p>Despite their reputation—as well as that of the powers they draw on and associate with—good-aligned shadowcasters are no less common than their neutral or evil counterparts. Most lean toward lawful alignments, due to the sheer discipline required to master bizarre formulae and to hold alien and often seemingly contradictory theories in mind, but neutral shadowcasters are not uncommon, and even chaotic ones are not unheard of.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-shadowcaster">Creating a Shadowcaster<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-shadowcaster" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Think about how you became what you are. What inspired you to study a form of magic—and a philosophy of the nature of reality—so different from all others, so greatly mistrusted? What drove you to such lengths to satisfy your curiosity, even at the risk of ostracism or madness? How did you even learn of shadow magic, let alone begin to find sufficient lore or an experienced shadowcaster to teach you? What do you plan to do with this dark power now that you have it? Is understanding it sufficient? Were you planning to do terrible things with it, assuming that shadow magic must be a power of evil? If so, how have your plans—how have you—changed now that you know better?</p>
<p>What about your relations with others? Do most people shun you for your fascination with darkness, assuming you insane or even threatening? How has this influenced the degree to which you value those few who do not judge you, who are willing to stand by you? Or have you avoided suspicion thus far, hiding the source of your magic and the true extent of what you can do, masquerading as a more traditional sort of spellcaster? Are you adventuring solely to amass further knowledge? To attain some other personal goal? Simply to prove yourself as something other than the lone eccentric or even looming villain that others see you as?</p>

<p>Penumbral Way</p>
<p>All shadowcasters draw on the magics of darkness, the void, and the Plane of Shadow, but each must choose a particular method or school of doing so. These include the way of the Dread Witch, the way of the Noctimancer, and the way of the Shadow Scion. Your choice of Penumbral Way grants you features at 1<sup>st</sup> level, and again at 6<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>Shadow Magic</p>
<p>Your study of the Plane of Shadow and of darkness, along with your more general arcane research, have granted you the ability to cast a variety of spells, many of which are intrinsically tied to shadow and known to no other casters.</p>
<p>CANTRIPS</p>
<p>You know three cantrips of your choice from the shadowcaster spell list. You learn additional shadowcaster cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown on the Cantrips Known column of the Shadowcaster table.</p>
<p>SPELL SLOTS</p>
<p>The Shadowcaster table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your shadowcaster spells of 1<sup>st</sup> level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>For example, when you are 5<sup>th</sup> level, you have two 3<sup>rd</sup>- level spell slots. To cast the 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell dusk and dawn, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level spell.</p>
<p>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</p>
<p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spells of your choice from the shadowcaster spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Shadowcaster table shows when you learn more shadowcaster spells of your choice of 1<sup>st</sup> level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6<sup>th</sup> level, for example, you learn a new shadowcaster spell, which can be 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shadowcaster spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shadowcaster spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. (Remember, however, that many Mysteries require you to have completed Paths, or to have access to a certain number of Paths, as part of their prerequisite. If you no longer meet these prerequisites due to replacing a spell, you lose access to that Mystery’s benefits.)</p>
<p>SPELL PATHS</p>
<p>In addition to being divided by level, as with other classes, shadowcaster spells are also divided into related groups of three called Paths. Initiate-level Paths include spells of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> level; Intermediate-level Paths of 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup> level; and Master-level Paths of 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, and 9<sup>th</sup> level. (You learn spells of 6<sup>th</sup> level and above by taking certain Mysteries, not through your standard shadow magic class feature. Mysteries are magical or supernatural abilities you possess, as described below.) In most ways, these Paths are purely thematic, like spell schools. You are not required to complete a Path once begun, nor are you required to choose spells from a Path in order. When you learn a 5<sup>th</sup>-level spell, for instance, it need not come from the same Path as any 4<sup>th</sup>-level spells you know.</p>
<p>Certain Mysteries, however, do require that you have completed a Path in order to take them, while others require that you have access to spells from multiple different Paths. Thus, depending on which Mysteries you wish to take, it may be more advantageous to focus your spells and complete a few Paths; or go for a broad selection of abilities instead. Each has its advantages.</p>
<p>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</p>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your shadowcaster spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shadowcaster spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<p>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</p>
<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your shadowcaster spells.</p>
<p>eyes of nighteyes of night</p>
<p>At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain darkvision 60 feet (or an additional 60 feet, if you already have darkvision), and you suffer no disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks when the area you are in, or into which you are looking, is obscured by dim light.</p>
<p>Mysteries Of Shadow</p>
<p>As you delve deeper into your investigations of night, of the void, of the Plane of Shadow, you learn scraps and snippets of larger, incomprehensible eldritch truths. These secrets, known as Mysteries of Shadow, grant you additional mystical abilities, powers, or simple understanding. At their highest levels, some even grant you the ability to cast spells of higher level than your shadow magic spell slots would normally permit. At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain two Mysteries of Shadow of your choice. Your mystery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain shadowcaster levels, you gain additional mysteries of your choice, as shown in the Mysteries Known column of the Shadowcaster table.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mysteries you know and replace it with another mystery that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>
<p>Gloaming Feast</p>
<p>When you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level, your bond to the Plane of Shadow allows you to absorb tenebrous energies that fulfil or mitigate certain biological needs. You no longer require food or drink. Additionally, you only need four hours of sleep (or trance for only two, if you’re an elf), which is sufficient for you to finish a long rest. At 8<sup>th</sup> level, your needs lessen even further, to a single hour of sleep (or half an hour of trance) per night. At 13<sup>th</sup> level, you become immune to nonmagical disease and poison. Finally, at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you no longer need to breathe, and never require sleep or trance. Magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
<p>Ability Score Improvement</p>
<p>When you reach 4<sup>th</sup> level, and again at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 19<sup>th</sup> level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Shade-Touched Soul</p>
<p>At 7<sup>th</sup> level, the darkness with which you so regularly interact has wound itself into your sense—and strength— of self. You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws, if you do not already have it.</p>
<p>Never-Ending Night</p>
<p>At 20<sup>th</sup> level, when you roll for initiative and have no spell slots remaining, you regain 1 Shadow Magic spell slot.</p>
<p>Penumbral Ways</p>
<p>All shadowcasters are a bit odd, even compared to other spellcasters. The effort to understand the metaphysical meaning and powers of darkness, of the Plane of Shadow’s influence on the real world, is stressful to even the strongest minds, requiring mastery of formulae and arcane theories that fly in the face of sanity. Thus, in order to avoid shattering their minds, all shadowcasters approach their art through one specific aspect of darkness, one particular area where—be it factually or thematically—the Plane of Shadow overlaps reality. This combination of approach and framework of study is called a Penumbral Way. Three of the most common focus on fear as a representation of inner darkness; on the intertwining of shadow’s influence on magic itself; and on the literal connection between planes, where the Plane of Shadow actually affects the environment of the Material Plane.</p>
<p>Dread Witch</p>
<p>The so-called Dread Witch approaches shadow magic through the lens of the sentient mind. The darkness within—fear, primarily, but also despair and other “negative” emotions as well—form a conduit to the darkness beyond that of the rational world. By learning to manipulate terror, both their own and others’, the Dread Witch learns to tap into greater and more tangible magics as well.</p>
<p>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</p>
<p>Due to their focus on fear and related “dark” emotions, Dread Witches can select from an expanded list of spells when learning shadowcaster spells. The following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell list for you.</p>
<p>DREAD HEART</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> level command</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> level phantasmal force</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> level fear</p>
<p>DREAD NIGHTMARES</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> level phantasmal killer</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup> level dream</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> level magic jar</p>
<p>DREAD SOUL</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup> level power word fear*</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup> level antipathy/sympathy</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup> level weird</p>
<p>*- indicates a new spell presented in this book</p>
<p>DREAD PRESENCE</p>
<p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. In addition, as an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. Creatures that fail their saving throws are frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>FEAR-WIELDER</p>
<p>At 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead of your normal proficiency bonus. In addition, when you are subject to an effect meant to cause you to become frightened—even if you successfully save or are immune to fear—you can choose to gain a special form of inspiration that you must spend before the end of your next turn. You can gain this even if you already have inspiration. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>DREAD MASTER</p>
<p>Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain resistance to psychic damage. In addition, you are immune to fear, and when another creature targets you with an effect that causes the frightened condition, you can use your reaction to turn the fear back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.</p>
<p>LIVING NIGHTMARE</p>
<p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can tap into a creature’s subconscious fears. As an action, choose a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that isn’t a construct or undead within 60 feet of you. If the creature requires sleep, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failed save, you have gained access to its subconscious mind, though it is not aware of that fact.</p>
<p>If the target falls asleep at any point within the next 24 hours, so long as it remains on either the same plane as you or on the Plane of Shadow, you instantly become aware of that fact and can enter a trance as if you cast the dream spell on the target. You must choose the monstrous version of the spell, and you are the messenger. When the target awakens, you are aware it has done so and can choose to immediately teleport to a space within 15 feet of the target that it can see. The target is automatically surprised.</p>
<p>Once you use Living Nightmare, you can’t do so again until after a long rest.</p>
<p>Noctimancer</p>
<p>All shadowcasters understand that shadow is the truest, most fundamental aspect of reality. Take away light, there is darkness; take away heat, there is cold. Noctimancers, or night mages, focus on the shadow that underlies magic. Through their studies, they learn not only to tap into the power of the Plane of Shadow, but to use the underlying reality to manipulate magic itself.</p>
<p>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</p>
<p>Their ability to weave shadow into other, more traditional forms of magic allows Noctimancers to select from an expanded list when learning shadowcaster spells. The following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell list for you.</p>
<p>EMANATIONS UNNATURAL</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> level detect magic</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> level arcanist’s magic aura</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> level dispel magic</p>
<p>ARCANA UNBOUND</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> level freedom of movement</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup> level eldritch twilight*</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> level spell echo*</p>
<p>THE WEAVE UNMADE</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup> level spell turning*</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup> level antimagic field</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup> level eclipse arcane*</p>
<p>*- indicates a new spell presented in this book</p>
<p>KNOWLEDGE ARCANE</p>
<p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. In addition, you learn to cast comprehend languages and identify as rituals, without requiring material components. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means.</p>
<p>ELDRITCH WARD</p>
<p>At 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Also, when you are targeted by a spell that either requires an attack roll or forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll or to gain advantage on the saving throw. (If a spell involves both an attack roll and a saving throw, you impose disadvantage on the attack roll but gain no benefit on the save.) One you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>ARCANE SECRETS</p>
<p>At 10<sup>th</sup> level, choose three spells from the wizard spell list that do not also appear on the shadowcaster spell list: one 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell, one 2<sup>nd</sup>-level (or lower) spell, and one 3<sup>rd</sup>-level (or lower) spell. You add these to your spells known, and they are shadowcaster spells for you. At 14<sup>th</sup> level, add one additional wizard spell that does not appear on your shadowcaster spell list, of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower, to your spells known. It is a shadowcaster spell for you.</p>
<p>MYSTIC SIPHON</p>
<p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you successfully use counterspell, dispel magic, or similar magics to negate an existing spell of 1<sup>st</sup> level or higher cast by another creature, you can capture a shred of the magic you just unwove and bend it to your own purpose. Choose one of the following effects.
- If the spell level is 4<sup>th</sup> level or higher, regain a spent shadowcaster spell slot. This spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and then fades away if unused.
- Cure one disease afflicting you.
- Remove one level of exhaustion afflicting you.
- End one of the following conditions afflicting you: blinded, deafened, restrained (if caused by magic), or poisoned.
- Make an immediate saving throw against one ongoing effect or condition afflicting you that is ended by a saving throw. If the effect is one that gets worse on a failed save, this extra saving throw does not worsen the effect if it fails.
- Gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw made within 1 minute. You can’t choose this option again until you expend the advantage it grants.
- Regain 1d6 hit points per level of the spell you countered or dispelled.</p>
<p>Shadow Scion</p>
<p>Perhaps the most straightforward of the Umbral Ways, the Shadow Scion studies the movement of the Plane of Shadow and the dark energies that permeate it, through its interactions and overlap with the Material Plane. By manipulating planar boundaries they can not only weave magic of shadows, but use the environment of the Plane of Shadow to alter portions of the physical world.</p>
<p>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</p>
<p>Their studies allow Shadow Scions to select from an expanded list when learning shadowcaster spells. The following spells and Paths are added to the shadowcaster spell list for you.</p>
<p>BREATH OF THE SHADOW</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> level fog cloud</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> level gust of wind</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> level sleet storm</p>
<p>THE SHADOW LOOMS</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> level control water</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup> level cone of cold</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> level move earth</p>
<p>THE SHADOW BLEEDS</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup> level ephemeral storm*</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup> level control weather†</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup> level storm of vengeance†</p>
<p>*- indicates a new spell presented in this book</p>
<p>†-indicates a spell that varies from its standard description (see Shadowcaster Spells)</p>
<p>WARDING SHADE</p>
<p>At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, the shadows of the environment lash out on your behalf. You can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>CHILD OF TWO WORLDS</p>
<p>As of 6<sup>th</sup> level, you no longer suffer exhaustion from extremes of heat or cold, nor do you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to wind or rain. Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can choose to infuse yourself with the essence of the Plane of Shadow. You gain resistance to cold damage and necrotic damage, but vulnerability to radiant damage, until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>FLESH OF SHADOW</p>
<p>Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, as an action, you can transform into a shadow elemental. You revert to your normal form after a number of hours equal to half your shadowcaster level, when you spend a bonus action to do so, if you drop to 0 hit points, if you fall unconscious, or if you die. Your game statistics are replaced by those of the elemental, except as follows. You retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the shadow elemental. If the elemental has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the elemental’s bonus instead of yours.</p>
<p>When you transform, you assume the elemental’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.</p>
<p>While transformed, you cannot cast spells, though transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell you’ve already cast. You can speak, but only in a whisper, and must be within 10 feet of another creature for it to hear you.</p>
<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the elemental is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses unless the elemental also has that sense.</p>
<p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with your elemental form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>
<p>Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
<p>MAELSTROM OF SHADOW</p>
<p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can draw forth a temporary funnel cloud of shadow-stuff. As an action, choose one 5-foot square within 60 feet that you can see. A column of swirling cloud and darkness descends from the sky (or ceiling) to touch the ground in that space and lasts until the end of your next turn. A creature in the column when it appears, or who enters the column for the first time during a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw against your shadowcaster spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is restrained.</p>
<p>The area is heavily obscured. A creature restrained by the column can’t sense or affect the world outside the column, and nothing outside the column can affect the creature. It sees only swirling darkness, hears only the roar of winds on the Plane of Shadow.</p>
<p>At the end of your next turn, just before the funnel vanishes, the creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and 5d10 damage of one other type of your choice: either cold, lightning, or thunder.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Mysteries Of Shadow</p>
<p>If a mystery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the mystery at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. If you later cease to meet the prerequisite—perhaps because you’ve traded out a necessary spell or other mystery—you lose all benefits of that mystery until you once again meet the prerequisites. You can only select a given mystery once, unless the mystery description specifies otherwise.</p>
<p>ANIMATE SHADOW</p>
<p>You can cast unseen servant at will, without requiring material components and without expending a spell slot. Once you have done so, you must finish a short rest before you can do so again. You do not have a shadow during the duration, as it becomes the unseen servant.</p>
<p>ASCENDANT SHADE</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 11<sup>th</sup> level</p>
<p>As an action, you gain the benefits of both the levitate and water walk spells with a duration of concentration up to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>BALEFUL SHADE</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 5<sup>th</sup> level</p>
<p>You can cast bestow curse once using a shadowcaster spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>CHILD OF NIGHT</p>
<p>You learn the find familiar spell. This spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.</p>
<p>Your familiar, regardless of what form it takes, is clearly a creature of shadow. It is unnaturally dark of hue; wisps of darkness trail from its skin and eyes. It gains darkvision 60 feet (if it doesn’t already have it). While the familiar is in dim light or darkness, attacks against the familiar have disadvantage unless the attacker can see the familiar clearly. While the familiar is in bright light, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
<p>CREEPING SHADOW</p>
<p>Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Initiate-level Paths</p>
<p>You learn two additional shadowcaster cantrips, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known column of the shadowcaster table.</p>
<p>You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must know three additional qualifying spells each time; you can’t use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once. So, for instance, you could select this mystery a second time once you know spells from six total Initiate Paths, a third time if you know spells from nine, and so forth.</p>
<p>DARK CONDUIT</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 5<sup>th</sup> level</p>
<p>You have learned to cast spells through the edges of the Plane of Shadow so that their passage through the Material Plane is warped. As a bonus action, choose a target that you could clearly see at any point since the start of your last turn, but that you can no longer see. Before the end of your turn, you can cast a spell that targets only that creature even if the spell requires you to see your target. In addition, the target gains no benefit of being invisible to you, and it gains no protection from cover against this spell. You must be aware of a target’s presence to use this feature on it.</p>
<p>DARKEST CREEPING SHADOW</p>
<p>Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Master-level Paths</p>
<p>You learn one additional shadowcaster cantrip or 1<sup>st</sup>- level shadowcaster spell (your choice of which), and one additional shadowcaster spell of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known and Spells Known columns of the shadowcaster table.</p>
<p>DISTANT VISIONS</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 15<sup>th</sup> level</p>
<p>You can cast clairvoyance without expending a spell slot or requiring components.</p>
<p>EMISSARY OF NIGHT</p>
<p>You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill, and in your choice of either the Intimidate or Sleight of Hand skill.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS OF SHADOW</p>
<p>Choose three shadowcaster cantrips that you know. You no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly material components to cast those cantrips (you can still benefit from using an arcane focus).</p>
<p>In addition, you can choose to cast one of these cantrips as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a spell as a bonus action using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing three different cantrips each time.</p>
<p>GREATER CREEPING SHADOW</p>
<p>Prerequisite: You must know at least one shadowcaster spell from three separate Intermediate-level Paths</p>
<p>You learn one additional shadowcaster cantrip and one 1<sup>st</sup>-level shadowcaster spell, beyond those shown in the Cantrips Known and Spells Known columns of the shadowcaster table.</p>
<p>You can take this mystery multiple times, but you must know three additional qualifying spells each time; you can’t use the same Paths as prerequisites more than once. So, for instance, you could select this mystery a second time once you know spells from six total Intermediate Paths.</p>
<p>GREATER PATH SAVANT</p>
<p>Prerequisite: Path Savant</p>
<p>Choose an Initiate-level or Intermediate-level Spell Path to which you have already applied the Path Savant mystery. You can cast one spell of 5<sup>th</sup> level or lower from that Path, at your normal shadowcaster spell slot level, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can take this mystery multiple times, applying it to a different qualifying Path each time.</p>
<p>GUARDIAN SHADE</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 3<sup>rd</sup> level</p>
<p>As an action, you animate your own shadow to fight for you in battle. It materializes in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a shadow, with the following alterations:
- It is an elemental instead of undead.
- It shares your alignment.
- It can’t create new shadows.</p>
<p>You must concentrate to maintain this effect, as though it were a spell. The shadow remains active until you cease concentrating, until it is reduced to zero hit points, or 1 minute, at which point it returns to its normal form. You don’t cast a shadow for the duration. Once you use this mystery, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level, you manifest two shadows rather than one. This increases to three at 11<sup>th</sup> level, and four at 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>LIFE-TAKER</p>
<p>Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one cantrip that deals necrotic or cold damage</p>

<p>Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, or 8<sup>th</sup> level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using an 8<sup>th</sup>- level slot, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this mystery, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. A spell obtained by this mystery counts as a known spell for purposes of determining whether you’ve completed a Path, and how many Paths you have access to.</p>
<p>MASTER OF GREATER SHADOW MAGIC</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 13<sup>th</sup> level</p>
<p>Choose one shadowcaster spell of 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> level. You can cast this spell once, as though cast using a 7<sup>th</sup>-level slot, without expending a spell slot.

<p>You can cast invisibility on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or requiring any components.</p>
<p>NURTURING DARKNESS</p>
<p>If you spend the entirety of a short rest in darkness, and then spend hit dice to regain health, you can roll each die twice and choose the better of the two results. Additionally, if you spend any number of hit dice after a short rest spent in darkness, you can remove one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>PATH SAVANT</p>
<p>Prerequisite: At least one complete Spell Path</p>
<p>Choose a Spell Path for which you know all three spells. You no longer require verbal, somatic, or non-costly material components to cast spells from that Path (You can still benefit from using an arcane focus). In addition, you can choose to cast one of these spells as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast a spell as a bonus action using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You can take this mystery multiple times, choosing three different cantrips each time.</p>
<p>SHADOW STEP</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 7<sup>th</sup> level</p>
<p>When you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.</p>

Once you end the spell in this way, you can’t use Steel Shadows again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>SWIFTER THAN THE EYE</p>
<p>Prerequisite: 5<sup>th</sup> level</p>
<p>When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 bonus action, you can use your action to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action. Once you use this mystery, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>TOUCH OF DARKNESS</p>
<p>You can cast spider climb on yourself without expending a spell slot. In addition, all ability checks made to track you have disadvantage, and you can walk across water and other liquids, but you must end your turn on solid ground or Touch of Darkness ends immediately.</p>
<p>Once you use this mystery, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>When you reach 11<sup>th</sup> level as a shadowcaster, you no longer need to concentrate on spider climb when casting Touch of Darkness.</p>
<p>TWILIGHT EXPERTISE</p>
<p>Prerequisite: Proficiency in Sleight of Hand or Stealth</p>
<p>When you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or (Stealth) check in dim light or darkness, as long as you are proficient in that skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>

<p>Spells</p>
<p>As previously described, shadowcaster spells are divided into thematic Paths, as well as by level. Otherwise, they function as any other class spell list in the game. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) are new spells presented in this book.</p>
<p>Finally, existing spells marked with a dagger (†) function slightly differently from how they’re described when cast by a shadowcaster. Only the differences are described below.</p>

<p>Shadowcaster Spell Descriptions</p>
<p>Note that most shadowcaster spells clearly have an element of darkness to them, even if the spell normally would not. Weather effects include unnaturally inky clouds and streams of shadow amidst the precipitation, for instance, while physical objects they create or summon are murky of hue and shot through with inky, fluctuating veins. Only those spells whose effectiveness would be compromised by such obvious effects, such as illusions, lack these traits.</p>
<p>ARROW OF DUSK</p>
<p>Evocation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You launch a bolt of inky darkness at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 points of cold damage and has disadvantage on the next Strength or Dexterity check it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>A living creature reduced to 0 hit points by arrow of dusk falls unconscious and is stable, rather than dying or making death saves.</p>
<p>The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level (2d8), 11<sup>th</sup> level (3d8), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (4d8).</p>
<p>BEND PERSPECTIVE (VISIONS AND VEILS)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level divination</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 30 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small prism)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Choose a point you can see within range. You create an invisible magical sensor at that spot. You see through the sensor as though you were at that spot. Creatures that can see invisible objects see an eyeball in shades of black and gray.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can switch your viewpoint to your true position or back to the sensor. If you make an ability check, attack roll or saving throw that relies on Strength or Dexterity while your perspective occupies the sensor, you do so with disadvantage.</p>
<p>As an action, you can move the sensor up to 15 feet to another point within range. If you move farther than 30 feet from the sensor, the spell ends.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>BLACK CANDLE</p>
<p>Illusion cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, M (a candle wick or a bit of wax)</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a tiny mote of illumination on an object that is no larger than 5 feet in any dimension. The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 5 feet beyond that. Choose up to five creatures when you cast this spell. Only you and the chosen creatures can see or benefit from the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.</p>
<p>If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p>
<p>CARPET OF SHADOW (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A thick layer of darkness coats the ground in a 15-foot radius from a point you can see within range. For the duration, the affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the semisolid shadow until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the spell can use its action to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC. On a success it frees itself.</p>
<p>Shadowcasters using the Touch of Darkness Mystery are immune to all effects of this spell.</p>
<p>CONJURE UMBRAL SERVANT</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 minute</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (coal dust and crushed onyx)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You call forth a shadow elemental to serve you. In all other respects, this spell is identical to conjure elemental.</p>
<p>CONTROL WEATHER (THE SHADOW BLEEDS)</p>
<p>When casting control weather as a shadowcaster spell, you cannot raise the temperature to hotter than “cool,” and you cannot reduce precipitation to less than “overcast or ground fog.” Otherwise, the spell functions as normal.</p>
<p>CURTAIN OF GLOOM (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a few black or gray threads)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you can see within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 40 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall is opaque, and its area is heavily obscured by magical darkness.</p>
<p>Passing through the wall is particularly disorienting. Each time a creature enters the wall or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the rest of the creature’s movement is in the opposite direction the creature intended. Creatures that do not rely on sight, can see in magical darkness, or are native to the Plane of Shadow are immune to this effect of the wall.</p>
<p>DANCING SHROUD (WRITHING GLOOM)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a short length of black rope or cord)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You summon wisps and tendrils of semisolid shadow in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within range. The shadows are difficult terrain and can impede up to six creatures of your choice that you can see. When the spell is cast and when a chosen creature starts its turn in the area, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p>
<p>On a failed save, the creature is restrained. If a creature restrained in this way attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the spell fails, and the spell slot or usage is lost. It can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.</p>
<p>DOUSE</p>
<p>Transmutation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous, or up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You infuse the light before you with shade. All nonmagical light sources the size of a campfire or smaller in a 60-foot cube originating from you are affected. Choose one of the following options: Affected light sources now shed dim light out to the range they normally shed bright light for 1 hour. Creatures have resistance to any fire damage shed by affected light sources. You can extinguish one light source in the area, causing it to shed no light. If the light source was fire, the fire goes out. If the sources were some other form of nonmagical light such as luminous fungi, they are extinguished for 1 hour. As a bonus action, you can end the effects of the spell (extinguished flames don’t reignite). Small or larger creatures who produce nonmagical light are immune to this spell.</p>
<p>DUSK AND DAWN (SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self (30-foot radius)</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You can raise or lower the ambient light within range by one “step”—changing bright light or darkness to dim light, or changing dim light to bright light or darkness. At any time during the duration, you can spend an action to change the level again (though you can never change it to two “steps” beyond its ambient level).</p>
<p>Darkvision and magical light function normally in dim light and darkness created by this spell. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the radius of the effect increases by 15 feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>ECLIPSE ARCANE (THE WEAVE UNMADE) 9<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self (60-foot radius)</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>All ongoing spells of 7<sup>th</sup> level or lower within the radius are automatically dispelled, as per dispel magic. For each spell of 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> level in the area, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends. When casting eclipse arcane, you can choose to exclude any spell effects currently affecting you or objects in your possession.</p>
<p>ELDRITCH TWILIGHT (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>Shadowy tendrils intertwined with threads of magic expand in a 20-foot sphere from a point you can see within range. The area becomes dim light for the duration. The mystic shadows interfere with spellcasting. A creature within the area that attempts to cast a spell, or a creature outside the area that casts a spell targeting anything in the area, must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. Targets proficient in the Arcana skill can add their proficiency bonus to the roll, even if their spellcasting ability is not Intelligence. On a failure, the spell fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted. Shadowcasters who are outside the spell’s area can cast their spells into the area normally.</p>
<p>EPHEMERAL IMAGE</p>
<p>(DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 1,000 miles</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours</p>
<p>You create a duplicate of yourself, made up semisolid shadow, anywhere within range that you can see or have seen before. This functions identically to the spell project image, with the following alterations:
- Because the illusion is semisolid, mild physical interaction with it does not reveal it to be an illusion. A successful attack, or a creature that uses its action to physically examine the image and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC reveals the image’s true nature.
- The image can manipulate small objects, as per the mage hand spell.
- You can cast spells of 5<sup>th</sup> level or lower through the image, as though you occupied its space.
- The illusion can fly at its normal speed (twice your walking speed). If you restrict its movement in a given round to half that speed, you can cause it to move as a bonus action rather than a normal action.
- If the illusion takes damage, you can make a Constitution saving throw as if you took the damage dealt to the image. If you succeed, the illusion doesn’t disappear.</p>
<p>EPHEMERAL STORM</p>
<p>(THE SHADOW BLEEDS)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 200 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A tumult of slicing shadows and white lightning crash down from the heavens in a 15-foot radius around a point you can see within range.

<p>When you cast the spell, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to be unaffected by it.</p>

<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Up to 8 hours</p>
<p>Choose one creature within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is beset with tiny shadows at the corner of its vision. The target has disadvantage on the next Intelligence or Wisdom check it makes, or on its passive Perception against the next Dexterity (Stealth) check made to hide from it. The spell then ends.</p>
<p>The spell ends if you cast it again.</p>
<p>HELLISH REBUKE</p>
<p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror, polished coin, or other means of creating a flickering light)</p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>A writhing, shifting pattern of shadow appears at a point you can see within range. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 30 feet of the chosen point, and who can see it, are affected in ascending order of their current hit points. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is charmed until the spell ends. A creature charmed in this way is paralyzed. The charmed condition ends if the creature takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature out of its stupor. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot above first.</p>
<p>IMPRISONMENT (WORLDS APART)</p>

<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror or prism)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to ten minutes</p>
<p>You instantly become aware of and can see any magical sensors (such as arcane eye, or those created by clairvoyance or scrying) currently observing you, or that begin to observe you during the duration. As an action, you can focus on a sensor and force that spell’s caster to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose one of the following options:</p>
<p>The spell used to create the sensor ends.</p>
<p>You create a sensor and observe the caster as if you successfully cast the scrying spell on them. If the caster ceases concentration on their spell, you can choose to maintain it as long as you concentrate on infinite mirror, allowing both of you to continue observing through your sensors as normal. You can use this option on only one spell at a time, and you can end your observation on an existing spell at any time.</p>
<p>A creature that succeeds on its saving throw can’t be affected by this casting ofinfinite mirror.</p>
<p>INVESTITURE OF SHADOW</p>
<p>(HANDS OF DUSK)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Darkness suffuses your body for the duration, granting you the following benefits.
- You have resistance to cold and necrotic damage.
- Your walking speed increases by 20, you gain a climb speed equal to your new walking speed, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1-inch wide.
- You can use your action to create a wave of darkness that fills the area within 15 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 cold and 2d8 necrotic damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not blinded on a successful one.</p>
<p>LIFE FADES (TOUCH OF TWILIGHT)</p>

<p>Range: 15 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature that isn’t a construct or undead within range. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from this spell can’t exceed two levels. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above first.</p>
<p>LIQUID NIGHT</p>
<p>Conjuration cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a vial, bottle, bowl, or other container to hold the ink)</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You cause the shadows to coalesce into a small quantity of ink in an empty container you are holding. This creates enough ink to write a page’s worth of text. It is not of sufficient quality to be used for scribing spells. When you cast the spell, you can decide if the ink behaves normally, or if it glows a faint red in dim light or darkness. In the latter case, the ink and anything written or drawn with it sheds dim light out to 5 feet.</p>
<p>If you cast this spell again before the ink is used to write, paint, stain, or dye something, the previous casting’s worth of ink disappears.</p>
<p>NIGHTFIRE (SHADOWS SPREAD)</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (ash from a fire that was doused rather than burning itself out)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>An eerie black and gray flame erupts from the ground in a 5-foot sphere centered on a point you can see. The flame sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>
<p>When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on its turn, or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 1d10 cold damage and 1d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much of each on a successful one. In addition, the creature is limned in ghostly flame until the start of its next tur while so illuminated, the creature cannot benefit from invisibility and has disadvantage on Stealth checks. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the flame up to 60 feet in any direction.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, either the cold or necrotic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot above second.</p>
<p>OBSCURING SHADOWS</p>
<p>(TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 20 feet</p>
<p>Components: V</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You wrap twisting shadows around up to six creatures within range that you can see. All attack rolls against a target obscured by this spell have disadvantage. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p>
<p>PASS INTO SHADOW (EBON ROADS)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (an uncut jet or onyx worth at least 200 gp)</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to the Plane of Shadow. Other than allowing passage to only that single plane, pass into shadow otherwise functions as the spell plane shift.</p>
<p>POWER WORD FEAR (DREAD SOUL)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level enchantment</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You speak a dread word of power that causes inescapable, soul-deep panic to assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to overwhelming terror. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being frightened.</p>
<p>While the target is affected by this numbing terror, the target must move before taking any other action each turn, and it must move as far from you as possible. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws other than Wisdom saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell slot or usage is wasted.</p>
<p>A target suffering this fear can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p>PRISON OF NIGHT (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 100 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a rod of polished jet or onyx worth at least 400 gp)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a 10-foot cube of opaque shadow centered on a point you can see. The cube blocks line of sight. When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the cube and must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>As an action, a creature can attempt to push through the shadowy walls by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. A creature that touches the cube takes 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 necrotic damage.</p>
<p>SCREEN (DEEPEST SHADOW PLAY)</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 24 hours</p>
<p>You create an entire illusory scene, complete with sights, sounds, scents, and even feel, which can be as large as a 100-foot cube within range. Within that area, you can make terrain and structures appear however you like. You can create illusory creatures, who behave as you describe, and you can decide whether real creatures, objects, or structures are visible or invisible on an individual basis. You set the descriptions and behavior of illusory creatures, and cloak existing creatures when you cast the spell and can’t change these decisions later. A creature made invisible by this spell that makes an attack, damages a creature, or forces a creature to make a saving throw becomes visible. Each round on your turn, harmful images created by the spell can deal 1d8 psychic damage to up to six creatures interacting with them according to the parameters you set. The creatures believe the damage takes the form of whatever is appropriate; a wolf’s ripping jaws, burns from lava, crushing boulders tumbling down a cliff, etc.</p>
<p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the area’s true form; but all other aspects of the illusion remain, so creatures can still physically interact with the illusion, which appears hazy and translucent to them. Creatures, objects, or pieces of terrain created by the illusion vanish if they leave the area.</p>
<p>SHADOW FORM (CLOAK OF SHADE)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a bit of smooth obsidian or dark glass)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You become a living shadow, appearing as a dark, wavering silhouette of yourself. Equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form. You can’t use or benefit from any equipment while a shadow. While in this form, your walking speed is reduced by 10, but you gain a climb speed equal to your reduced walking speed. While in dim light or darkness you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks; and gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, as well as on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You gain vulnerability to radiant damage, and when in bright light, attacks against you gain advantage. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If you fall, you do so slowly. You fall 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</p>
<p>While in this form, you can’t make weapon attacks, cast spells, or manipulate objects or creatures. You can speak, but only in a rough whisper.</p>
<p>For the duration, you can make a special draining attack as an action. Make a melee spell attack with a reach of 15 feet. If you hit, the target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 necrotic damage.</p>
<p>SHADOW OUT OF TIME</p>
<p>(SHADOW’S EMBRACE)</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 3 rounds</p>
<p>You transport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying to an isolated pocket of the Plane of Shadow where time moves faster. This pocket is a cylindrical space 20 feet wide and 20 feet high. It is blank and featureless, save for a small planar window that shows the area you just left. The window allows observation only; you can’t interact in any way through the window, and the window is invisible from the other side. During each turn you take in the pocket, you can take three turns worth of actions. Creatures observed through the window appear to move in slow motion.</p>
<p>While in the shadow pocket, you can only affect yourself and objects you brought with you. You can end the spell early as an action. When the spell ends, you reappear on the Material Plane in an unoccupied space anywhere within 1,000 feet of the spot where you cast the spell.</p>
<p>SHADOW PUPPETS (HANDS OF DUSK)</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You summon a broad swathe of coiling, grasping shadows. Choose a point you can see within range; the shadows occupy a 30-foot-radius sphere from that point. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain for your enemies. At the start of each of your turns, each enemy within 10 feet of a light source within the radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d12 cold damage if the light source is a fire or otherwise radiates heat, or 2d12 necrotic damage if the light source is magical or otherwise radiates no heat.</p>
<p>At the start of your turn, choose one creature within the area. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled by the shadows. The creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can command the shadows to lash out against one creature within the area. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 cold damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>SHROUD OF NIGHTMARE</p>
<p>(CLOAK OF SHADE)</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 10 minutes</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature, surrounding it with a flickering aura of shade. For the duration, when the target makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. A creature that forces the target to make one of those saving throws immediately takes 2d8 psychic damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2<sup>nd</sup>, to a maximum of 4d8.</p>
<p>SPELL ECHO (ARCANA UNBOUND)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet, and see text</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Special; see text</p>
<p>Choose any spell of 4<sup>th</sup>-level or lower, with a casting time of 1 action or less, that was cast by another creature within range since the end of your last turn. You must have been able to see the caster and any effect of the spell itself. You immediately duplicate that spell, targeting it as you choose, and using your own abilities, and spell save DC. It follows all the normal rules of range, targeting, school, duration, concentration, and so forth, though you are not required to provide any material components.</p>
<p>At Higher Level. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you can duplicate a spell of one level higher than fourth for each slot level above 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>SPELL TURNING (THE WEAVE UNMADE)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a small mirror worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A murky aura surrounds you, reflecting certain spells back at the caster. Only spells that specifically target you are affected; spells that affect an area which happens to include you are not.</p>
<p>Roll 1d4+6 when you cast this spell; this is the total number of spell levels the aura can reflect. When you are targeted by a spell, it instead affects the caster as though they were the target, and you subtract the spell’s level from the number of levels remaining. When you run out of levels remaining, the spell ends.</p>
<p>If you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the levels remaining to your spell turning, you may suffer only a partial effect, or reflect only a partial effect. If the levels remaining to your spell turning equal half or less than half of the spell’s level, you suffer a partial effect; if the levels remaining are greater than half the spell’s level, the caster suffers a partial effect.</p>
<p>When someone suffers a spell’s partial effect, they have advantage on any applicable saves, take only half of any damage, and the spell’s maximum duration is halved. If both you and the caster are under the effect of spell turning, you both subtract half the spell’s level from your remaining total and are both subject to a partial effect as described above.</p>
<p>SPIRIT GUARDIANS</p>
<p>(SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS)</p>
<p>When you cast spirit guardians, as a shadowcaster spell, the spirits appear as featureless, shadowy silhouettes, and deal necrotic damage, regardless of your alignment.</p>
<p>Storm of Vengeance (The Shadow Bleeds)</p>
<p>When you cast storm of vengeance as a shadowcaster spell, the rain in round two is shadow hail, dealing your choice of cold or necrotic damage rather than acid damage as per normal.</p>
<p>TWILIGHT TENDRIL</p>
<p>Evocation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 20 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A tendril of shadow lashes out at one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved 10 feet in any direction you choose, and then take 1d6 points of cold damage.</p>
<p>This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level (2d6), 11<sup>th</sup> level (3d6), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (4d6).</p>
<p>UMBRAL DOPPELGANGER</p>
<p>(BORN OF NIGHT)</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You send one creature that you can see within range to a pocket of the Plane of Shadow, while simultaneously summoning a shadowy duplicate of that creature to act on your behalf. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the target is not banished, and the duplicate appears in the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target and disappears at the end of its own turn. On a failed save, the target disappears, reappearing in the Plane of Shadow, while the duplicate appears in the space the target vacated. While in the Plane of Shadow, the target is incapacitated.</p>
<p>When it first appears, the duplicate is statistically identical to the target except for the following distinctions: The duplicate has resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage.
- All damage caused by the duplicate is either cold or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the spell), rather than the standard type caused by its weapons, spells, or other features.
- The duplicate can only cast spells/duplicate spell effects up to 6<sup>th</sup> level, whether on its own or via magic items, even if the original creature can cast or create higher-level magics.
- Any of the duplicate’s equipment that is removed or dropped disappears at the start of the duplicate’s next turn, unless the duplicate takes possession of it before then. The duplicate acts on the target creature’s initiative, losing all ties, and is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the duplicate, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p>
<p>The banished creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, or when the spell ends, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target returns before the spell ends, the duplicate disappears at the end of its next turn and the spell ends. The target and the duplicate have advantage on attack rolls against one another.</p>
<p>UMBRAL FORM (SHADOW’S EMBRACE)</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 8 hours</p>
<p>You step into the dimensional overlap between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow. With the exception of involving the Plane of Shadow instead of the Ethereal Plane, this otherwise functions in all respect as the spell etherealness.</p>
<p>UMBRAL HORDE (BORN OF NIGHT)</p>
<p>9<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round/2 rounds; see text</p>
<p>Choose up to five creatures within range; each target must attempt a Constitution save. On a failure, a target is banished to the Plane of Shadow and replaced by a dark duplicate, as per umbral doppelganger. On a success, the target is not banished, but the duplicate still appears adjacent to them.</p>
<p>The duplicates act as a group, immediately after you in the initiative order. If a target succeeded on its saving throw, that target’s duplicate vanishes at the end of its turn Targets sent to the Plane of Shadow are incapacitated and return at the end of your next turn. Their duplicates then disappear at the end of their own next turn. The duplicates function in all ways as described in umbral doppelganger.</p>
<p>UMBRAL TOOL (FORGED OF NIGHT)</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You summon a tool made of shadow into your free hand. This can be any mundane, simple tool: a hammer, a crowbar, a chisel, a saw, and so forth. It functions exactly like the real thing in all respects, and you can even pass it off to a companion for their own use.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a simple, one-handed weapon instead of a tool. It doesn’t count as magical for overcoming resistance or immunity to damage.</p>
<p>The items created by this spell are somewhat rough and lacking in detail, so if you use it to duplicate tools that require precision—such as thieves’ tools or calligrapher’s tools—you have disadvantage on checks made while using them.</p>
<p>VAMPIRIC WALL (TENEBROUS SHROUDS)</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level necromancy</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a few bloodstained black or gray threads)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a wall of shifting, swirling shadow at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall is opaque, but creatures and objects can pass through it. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Choose one creature that took damage from the wall. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage taken by that creature. When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn, or ends its turn there, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</p>
<p>Each time the wall deals necrotic damage due to a creature entering its area or ending a turn there, the length of the wall is reduced by 5 feet. If the length reaches 0, the spell ends.</p>
<p>VENGEFUL SHADE</p>
<p>Necromancy cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 30 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, M (a weapon)</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and is surrounded by dancing, writhing ribbons of shadow until the start of your next turn. If, before that time, the creature targets you with an attack or spell, or ends its movement closer to you than when it started, it immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage and the spell ends.</p>
<p>This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5<sup>th</sup> level, the weapon attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for targeting or closing on you increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11<sup>th</sup> level and 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>WINDOWS OF SHADE</p>
<p>(SHUTTERS AND CLOUDS)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (a pinch of coal dust)</p>
<p>Duration: Up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You gain the ability to see normally in darkness, even magical darkness, out to 60 feet.</p>
<p>At any point during the duration, you can spend a bonus action to end the spell and make a gaze attack against any living creature you can see, and that can see you, within 60 feet. The target takes 1d8 cold damage and 1d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. The creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns; if it can’t see you, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the effect ends</p>
<p>Shadow Elemental</p>
<p>The incarnated life forces of earth, air, fire, and water that exist on the elemental planes, that become traditional elementals when summoned to the Material World, have their own dark reflections on the Plane of Shadows. Initially mindless echoes, literal shadows, they eventually developed rudimentary awareness of their own. These have become so-called shadow elementals, entities of living shade, formed from the stuff of the Plane of Shadow. Nebulous Form. Unlike true elementals, shadow elementals maintain a semi-physical form at all times, even when unsummoned and freely roaming the Plane of Shadow. This form is constantly shifting, ranging from a blot of darkness all but invisible in the gloom of their home realm, to looming, almost-but-not-quite humanoid silhouettes. Even in the brightest illumination, which shadow elementals find deeply unpleasant, their boundaries are inky and indistinct, like a haze or a dark watercolor painting.</p>
<p>Loathing of Light and Life. Both the gleam of excess light and the warmth of living beings bring shadow elementals pain, and thus they lash out and seek to destroy the source of their discomfort. Like true elementals, they resent being summoned and forced into servitude, but they possess a hostility beyond even the capricious and often destructive instincts of more natural spirits. This doesn’t make them more difficult to control, but shadow elementals do tend toward more of what mortal beings would consider evil behaviors when free to act as they please.</p>
<p>Alone in the Dark. Shadow elementals are solitary entities. They aren’t hostile toward one another, but neither do they seek to congregate; if two or more find themselves in the same vicinity, they tend to simply ignore one another. While they show some understanding of all the various elemental languages, as well as the commands of any who summon them regardless of language, they appear to have no tongue of their own. If they are capable of speech or communication at all, no one has ever observed it. Elemental Nature. A shadow elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
