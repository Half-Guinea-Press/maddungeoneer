# Alchemist

A grinning gnome cackles with glee as he hurls a bomb into a group of charging goblins, blasting them into scorched chunks. He produces another, throws it at his feet, and disappears, still laughing, into the ensuing cloud of smoke.

A slender elf quickly mixes liquids and herbs in a small bowl. She applies the mixture to an arrow wound on an injured dwarf ’s side, which immediately stops bleeding.

Whether their methods are explosive, transformative, or restorative, alchemists live to transmute the world around them to their liking.

## Chemical Reactions

One of the first things an alchemist learns is how to mix chemicals that react explosively with each other. Ostensibly, this is taught to students to prevent deadly accidents, but adventuring alchemists regularly apply this knowledge to create bombs. An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.

## Serums and Tinctures

More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances into potions, alchemical concoctions which replicate magical effects. These potions range from the medicinal, such as potions of healing, to the transformative, such as potions of gaseous form, to the downright deadly, such as potions of poison. Undisputed masters of potions, alchemists constantly innovate with new formulations and preparations, improving their potions into magic items in their own right.

## Elemental Sciences

The primary source of alchemy’s power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher’s stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher’s stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets.

## Creating an Alchemist

When you create an alchemist, consider why you study alchemy. Are you attracted to its dangerous power or its ability to help others? Do you desire to use magic, but lack the aptitude or inborn ability? Why do you adventure? Are you searching for new alchemical formulae or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher’s stone? Be sure to understand alchemy’s place in your campaign world. You might have learned your trade from a master or studied alongside artificers and wizards in a university. Your trade might be commonplace or an oddity. Depending on the setting, you might be respected for your knowledge or feared for your destructive potential.

## QUICK BUILD

You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Choose any background.

## CLASS FEATURES

As an alchemist, you gain the following class features.

## HIT POINTS

Hit Dice: 1d6 per alchemist level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per alchemist level after 1st

## PROFICIENCIES

Armor: Light armor

Weapons: Simple weapons, bombs

Tools: Alchemist’s supplies, herbalism kit

Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence

Skills: Choose three from Arcana, History, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Survival

## EQUIPMENT

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted to you by your background:
- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) an explorer’s pack or (b) a scholar’s pack
- Alchemist’s supplies and (a) a vial of acid, (b) a vial of alchemist’s fire, or (c) a vial of basic poison
- Leather armor and a dagger

## Natural Philosopher

You have learned many things about alchemy during your studies. Starting at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any ability check you make to identify herbs, potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances. This bonus stacks with your normal proficiency bonus, if you would add that already.

## Bombs

At 1st level, you can create volatile alchemical bombs using your alchemist’s supplies. Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can create a number of bombs equal to 10 plus twice your alchemist level. For you the cost of materials necessary to create these bombs is negligible. After 24 hours, an unused bomb becomes inert. The statistics of a bomb are shown in the Bomb sidebar above.

Instead of making an attack with a bomb using the Attack action, once per turn you can take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb with explosive reagents and throw it, increasing the bomb’s explosive potential and allowing you to deal additional damage. When you do so, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to the bomb’s damage roll. Additionally, when you throw a bomb in this way, its damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

Saving Throws.

When your bombs call for a saving throw, its save DC is calculated as follows:

Bomb save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### BOMB

Bombs are exotic ranged weapons with the following statistics:

| Name | Cost | Damage    | Weight | Properties                             |
| :--: | :--: | :-------: | :----: | :------------------------------------: |
| Bomb | 2 sp | 1d10 fire | 1 lb.  | Finesse, special, thrown (range 30/90) |

#### SPECIAL PROPERTY: Bomb

When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 5-foot radius and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save or no damage on a successful one.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb’s explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb’s target.

#### MISSED BOMBS

As bombs are explosive projectiles, it makes sense to ask what happens if a thrown bomb fails to hit its target. For simplicity, we assume that missed bombs explode harmlessly in the background or fail to detonate altogether, but do not explode in the target’s space and deal damage with its blast radius. The GM can decide which of these two outcomes happens or can determine the outcome randomly.

## Bomb Formulae

By 2nd level, your research has granted you insight into new alchemical formulations for your bombs. Select three bomb formulae from the Bomb Formulae section below. Once per turn, when you take the Use an Object action to throw a bomb, you can apply a formula to it.

When you gain certain levels in this class, you learn additional formulae of your choice, as shown in the Bomb Formulae Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the formulae you know and replace it with another formula.

## Field of Study

While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level.

A formula granted by your field of study does not count against the total number of formulae you know.

## Reagent

Starting at 3rd level, you have a collection of powerful alchemical reagents, represented by a pool of reagent dice, that you can spend to brew potions or magnify the power of your explosives.

### REAGENT DICE

You start with three reagent dice, which are d10s, and you gain additional reagent dice as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Reagent Dice column of the Alchemist table. You regain all expended reagent dice when you finish a long rest.

When you take the Use an Object action to prime and throw a bomb, you can expend a number of reagent dice up to your proficiency modifier and add the dice to the bomb’s damage roll.

### BREWING POTIONS

You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of reagent dice to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it uses your bomb save DC.

The number of reagent dice and the alchemist level required to brew a potion are given on the

#### Potions table:

| Potion                        | Cost           | Lvl  |
| :---------------------------: | :------------: | :--: |
| Potion of Climbing            | 1 reagent die  | 3rd  |
| Potion of Growth              | 1 reagent die  | 3rd  |
| Potion of Healing             | 1 reagent die  | 3rd  |
| Potion of Water Breathing     | 1 reagent die  | 3rd  |
| Universal Solvent             | 1 reagent die  | 3rd  |
| Cure-All                      | 2 reagent dice | 7th  |
| Potion of Greater Healing     | 2 reagent dice | 7th  |
| Potion of Heroism             | 2 reagent dice | 7th  |
| Potion of Resistance          | 2 reagent dice | 7th  |
| Sovereign Glue (1 ounce)      | 2 reagent dice | 7th  |
| Potion of Diminution          | 3 reagent dice | 14th |
| Potion of Flying              | 4 reagent dice | 14th |
| Potion of Hill Giant Strength | 4 reagent dice | 14th |
| Potion of Invisibility        | 4 reagent dice | 14th |
| Potion of Superior Healing    | 4 reagent dice | 14th |

## REAGENT SYNTHESIS

Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain all of your expended reagent dice that you have not used to brew potions.

## Discoveries

In the course of your research, you have made a number of discoveries regarding the nature of alchemy. At 4th level, you gain two discoveries of your choice. When you gain certain alchemist levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Known column of the Alchemist table.

Additionally, when you learn a new discovery, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, as an alchemist, when you gain an ability score improvement, you can instead choose to learn a new Discovery for which you meet the prerequisites.

## Flashbang

Beginning at 5th level, you carry a supply of concussive explosives which help you escape from perilous situations. As a bonus action, you can throw one of these explosives at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

## Evasion

Beginning at 11th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

## Blast Coating

Starting at 15th level, you automatically succeed on saving throws against your own bombs and never take damage from them.

## Philosopher’s Stone

At 20th level, you unlock the crowning achievement of all alchemy: a philosopher’s stone, a dynamo of alchemical energy in a fist-sized glowing jewel. You can construct your philosopher’s stone using your alchemist supplies, 1,000 gp worth of materials, and 7 days of work. You can only have one philosopher’s stone at a time and only you can gain the stone’s benefits. As long as you possess the stone, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended reagent dice.
- You can brew potions as an action, instead of in 10 minutes.
- You age 10 times slower than normal, and your age cannot be magically changed.

Additionally, you learn the following formula, which doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know:

### FORMULA:NUCLEAR BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with your philosopher’s stone, you can change it into a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb deals 10d10 + 100 force damage instead of its normal fire damage, has a blast radius of 1 mile, and completely destroys the philosopher’s stone. Additionally, each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw takes the full bomb damage rolled, or half on a successful save. Creatures within 60 feet can’t avoid this damage with Evasion or other features or spells.

## BOMB FORMULAE

Bomb formulae are summarized on the following table. If a bomb is exclusively available to one field of study, it will be marked with an asterisk. Unless otherwise stated, all bombs produce a loud boom, audible out to one mile. Bombs are presented in alphabetical order.

| Withering Bomb     | d8 necrotic  | Constitution |

### ACID BOMB

By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of ardenflotic acid, a highly corrosive chemical, you can change it into an acid bomb. An acid bomb deals acid damage instead of fire damage and has d4 damage dice. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, takes the same amount of damage again at the end of its next turn.

### BRAMBLE BOMB

By adding a potent fertilizer to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a bramble bomb. A bramble bomb deals no damage, and instead causes tough, thorny brambles to sprout from any area of natural ground within the bomb’s blast radius, which becomes difficult terrain. Additionally, if a creature in the blast radius is prone when the bomb detonates, it is enveloped by the brambles and must make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by your bomb save DC in order to move or stand. The brambles shrivel and die after 1 minute.

### CRYO BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a piece of ice nine, you can change it into a cryo bomb. A cryo bomb deals cold damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has its speed decreased by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

### HOLY BOMB

By adding a few drops of holy water to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a holy bomb. A holy bomb deals radiant damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice, unless the target is a celestial, fiend, or undead. The bomb’s damage dice are d6s against celestials and d12s against fiends and undead.

### IMPACT BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a more reactive one, you can change it into an impact bomb. An impact bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is pushed 5 feet away from the center of the blast.

### INCENDIARY BOMB

By adding a thickening agent to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into an incendiary bomb. An incendiary bomb has d6 damage dice. Additionally, the area of the blast radius is engulfed in flames which persist until the beginning of your next turn. Flammable objects in this area that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. Any creature that ends its turn in this area takes half the bomb’s damage.

### LAUGHING GAS BOMB

By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a drop of jesterate, a highly euphoric chemical, you can change it into a laughing gas bomb. A laughing gas bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, has d6 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, falls prone in a fit of laughter. Once a creature falls prone due to this bomb's effects, it is immune to this effect (but not the bomb's poison damage) for 24 hours.

### LIGHTNING BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a charged arcane capacitor, you can change it into a lightning bomb. A lightning bomb deals lightning damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.

### NONLETHAL BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a pouch of rubber pellets, you can change it into a nonlethal bomb. A nonlethal bomb deals bludgeoning damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice. If damage from this bomb drops a creature to 0 hit points, it knocks the creature out, rather than dealing a killing blow, rendering the creature unconscious and stable. Additionally, this bomb’s rubber projectiles bounce around corners, ignoring half and three-quarters cover for targets within the blast radius.

### OIL BOMB

By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of a super-surfactant, you can change it into an oil bomb. An oil bomb does not deal damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a sticky, flammable oil. The next time a creature coated in oil takes fire damage, it takes an additional d6 damage for each die of fire damage rolled, up to a maximum of half your alchemist level, rounded up. Oil can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water.

### PRISMATIC BOMB

By adding an ounce of polyjuice, an unpredictable, multicolored chemical, to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a prismatic bomb. A prismatic bomb deals damage randomly-determined instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a randomly-determined type of saving throw. Roll on each of the following tables.

| d6   | Saving Throw |
| :--: | :----------: | 
| 1-2  | Dexterity    |
| 3-4  | Constitution |
| 5-6  | Wisdom       |

| d6   | Damage    |
| :--: | :-------: | 
| 1    | Acid      |
| 2    | Cold      |
| 3    | Fire      |
| 4    | Lightning |
| 5    | Poison    |
| 6    | Radiant   |

### PSIONIC BOMB

By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with dust from a psionic crystal, you can change it into a psionic bomb. A psionic bomb deals psychic damage instead of fire damage, has d6 damage dice, and requires a Wisdom saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws it makes to maintain concentration on spells until the end of its next turn.

### QUIET BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a wad of thermal cotton, you can change it into a quiet bomb. A quiet bomb has d8 damage dice. When this bomb detonates, it makes only a low thud, audible out to 10 feet, and releases a puff of smoke to mask the light given off by its blast. Creatures have disadvantage on ability checks to detect that this bomb was detonated nearby.

### SEEKING BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a powerful lodestone, you can change it into a seeking bomb. A seeking bomb has d6 damage dice. You don’t suffer disadvantage from making a ranged attack using this bomb while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature.

### SMOKE BOMB

By removing your bomb’s explosive contents entirely, you can change it into a smoke bomb. A smoke bomb deals no damage but fills a 10-foot radius sphere with smoke. This fog spreads around corners and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Once you throw one of these bombs, you can’t throw another for 1 minute.

### SONIC BOMB

By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of air elemental essence, you can change it into a sonic bomb. A sonic bomb deals thunder damage instead of fire damage, has d6 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is deafened until the end of its next turn.

### STINK BOMB

By adding a single drop of skunkanide, a chemical too unholy to expound upon, you can change it into a stink bomb. A stink bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on ability checks it makes before the end of its next turn.

### TELEPORTATION BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a glowing etherite crystal, you can change it into a teleportation bomb. A teleportation bomb deals no damage and instead opens a rift in space, instantly teleporting you to its point of detonation, if it explodes within 30 feet of you.

### THERMOBARIC BOMB

By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a delayed explosive, you can change it into a thermobaric bomb. A thermobaric bomb deals has d6 damage dice and explodes in a 10-foot radius sphere.

### WITHERING BOMB

By mixing your bomb’s explosive components with a powerful desiccating agent, you can change it into a withering bomb. A withering bomb deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t regain hit points until the end of its next turn.

## DISCOVERIES

If a discovery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the discovery at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. You can only learn a discovery once, unless otherwise specified.

### Advanced Poisoner

| Potion of Stone Giant Strength  | 4 reagent dice |

### ALCHEMY OF INFLUENCE

Prerequisite: 13th level

Your alchemical research has revealed many of the basic chemicals which govern emotions. You can brew the following potions:

| Potion                          | Cost           |
| :-----------------------------: | :------------: |
| Potion of Animal Friendship     | 1 reagent die  |

| Potion of Clairvoyance          | 3 reagent dice |
| Potion of Mind Reading          | 3 reagent dice |

### ALCHEMY OF TRANSFORMATION

Prerequisite: 13th level

You have mastered the alchemical secrets of shifting matter, which allow you to brew the following potions:

| Potion                 | Cost           |
| :--------------------: | :------------: |
| Oil of Slipperiness    | 2 reagent dice |

| Aqua Fortis            | 3 reagent dice |
| Chameleon Concoction   | 3 reagent dice |
| Potion of Gaseous Form | 3 reagent dice |

### ARCANE STUDY

You learn three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells.

### BALLISTICS RESEARCH

You learn two additional bomb formulae.

### BATTLE TRAINING

You gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields.

### BEGUILING HAZE

Prerequisites: 13th level, Amorist Field of Study

When you charm a creature, you can choose to place it in a dreamy state, from which it regards everyone it sees as close friends. While the creature is charmed, it is nonhostile and acts as though it is charmed equally by each creature it sees. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### BUFFERED METABOLISM

Prerequisites: 13th level, Xenoalchemist Field of Study

As a reaction when you take damage, you can expend any number of reagent dice up to your proficiency bonus to reduce the amount of damage taken by the total rolled on the dice.

### CLOTTING AGENT

You have developed a serum that thickens your blood. Your hit point maximum increases by your alchemist level + your Constitution modifier, and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

### CRAFT HOMUNCULUS

Using a special alchemical process requiring 8 hours of work, which can be performed over the course of a long rest, you can create a homunculus. A homunculus functions as a familiar summoned by the find familiar spell, with several differences:
- The telepathic link between you and your homunculus functions at any distance, provided you and your homunculus are on the same plane of existence.
- You cannot dismiss your homunculus as you would a familiar.
- Your homunculus is a construct and cannot assume a different form.
- Your homunculus can take the Attack action on its turn.

When your homunculus dies, its body remains, and can be reanimated in a procedure requiring 1 hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short or long rest.

### DEMOLITION SPREE

Prerequisite: 13th level, Mad Bomber Field of Study

When you take the Use an Object action to prime and throw a bomb, you can throw a number of bombs equal to the number of the bomb’s damage dice, instead of only one. Each bomb you throw deals 1d10 damage plus your Intelligence modifier and can’t target the same creature or space. You must spend reagent dice separately on these bombs and can apply a bomb formula to only one of them.

### EXPLOSIVE MISSILE

As a bonus action, you can load one of your bombs onto the head of a crossbow bolt. Instead of its normal damage, this bolt deals damage as if the bomb had been primed with the Use an Object action, but does not have a blast radius. Only one of your bombs can be loaded onto a bolt at a time, and you can’t fire an explosive bolt on the same turn you throw a bomb.

### FIRE BRAND

You can mix your bomb’s contents together and apply the fiery concoction to a melee weapon you are holding as a bonus action. Until the end of your turn, this melee weapon deals an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit. This bonus damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

### FIRE EATER

Instead of throwing a bomb, you use an action to drink its contents and spit them out in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage as if the bomb had been primed and thrown with the Use an Object action, or half as much on a successful save. When you use this ability, you take 1d4 points of fire damage each of your bomb’s damage dice.

### FIRE IN THE HOLE

Prerequisite: 9th level

You have tweaked your bomb’s formula to increase its explosive yield. Your bomb save DC increases by half your proficiency bonus, rounded down.

### FORTIFIED SERUM

Prerequisites: 13th level, Apothecary Field of Study

Whenever a creature regains hit points by drinking one of your potions, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons until the end of its next turn.

### GRENADIER

When you take the Use an Object action to prime and throw a bomb, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with a weapon that isn’t two-handed.

### DYNAMO CHARGER

Prerequisites: 13th level, Dynamo Engineer Field of Study

You’ve invented a device which rapidly recharges your spell dynamos. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain 2 expended spell slots stored in dynamos. You can configure these dynamos immediately.

### HEMOREAGENT

Prerequisite: 17th level

When you take the Use an Object action to throw a bomb, you can convert a measure of your own blood into reagents. You can add five or fewer reagent dice to the bomb’s damage roll, and you take 1d6 necrotic damage for each reagent die added. This damage can’t be avoided or reduced.

### LAZARUS BOLT

Prerequisite: 9th level

You’ve discovered a radical necromantic workaround: restoring life with direct electricity to the heart. As an action, you can drive a bolt into the torso of a creature within 5 feet of you that has died within the last minute and shock it back to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This feature can’t return to life a creature that lacks a heart, a creature that has died of old age, or a creature that is missing vital organs. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### MAGNIFIED BLAST

Prerequisite: 17th level

Thanks to a new internal design for your bombs, you have expanded their blast radius and magnitude. Whenever you add reagent dice to your bomb’s damage, you can also choose to expand the bomb’s blast radius by a distance of up to 5 feet per two reagent dice spent.

### OOZE COWBOY

Prerequisites: 13th level, Ooze Rancher Field of Study

Tired of waiting for your oozes to catch up with you, you’ve modified your formula to make extra fast slimes! All slimes you make have a movement speed of 30 feet, if it were lower. Additionally, you can ride any ooze you make of Medium size or larger as a mount. You and your equipment suffer no ill effect from touching your oozes directly. Lastly, your oozes add your proficiency modifier to their damage rolls and initiative rolls.

### POISONER

Your research into poisonous compounds has taught you how to concoct lethal toxins. You gain proficiency with the poisoner’s kit. Additionally, you can craft the following poisons when you brew potions, which use your bomb save DC instead of their normal save DC:

| Potion           | Cost           |
| :--------------: | :------------: |
| 2 × Basic Poison | 1 reagent die  |
| 2 × Antitoxin    | 1 reagent die  |
| Potion of Poison | 2 reagent dice |
| Oil of Taggit    | 2 reagent dice |
| Serpent Venom    | 2 reagent dice |
| Truth Serum      | 2 reagent dice |

### PRECISION EXPLOSIVES

You have modified your bombs to have narrow gaps in their explosions, perfect for keeping some creatures safe from the blast. You can choose one creature in the blast radius of a bomb other than the target to automatically succeed its saving throw against the bomb and take no damage from it.

### REACTIONARY GULP

Prerequisite: 17th level

By keeping your potions organized on a bandolier or in a series of pouches, you can quickly draw them in a moment’s notice. Immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to drink a potion.

### RECYCLED POTIONS

Prerequisite: 9th level

When you brew potions, you can distill those you have already brewed, recovering the reagents stored within. You can convert brewed potions into reagent dice and you can choose to expend those dice to create new potions. You can’t gain more than your maximum number of reagent dice using this ability.

### SYRINGE

Using a sophisticated hypodermic needle, you can more quickly administer potions and poisons. As a bonus action, you can inject a potion into yourself or a willing creature within 5 feet of you, granting the benefits of the potion as if it were drank normally. You can inject a potion into an unwilling creature with a successful melee attack.

### TRI-MUTATION

Prerequisites: 13th level, Mutagenist Field of Study

You’ve developed a powerful, but fleeting way of blending your mutagens together. When you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose to inject a tri-mutagen, which grants you the benefit of all your mutagens at once. This benefit lasts for 1 minute, or until you use your bonus action to inject yourself with a different mutagen. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## FIELDS OF STUDY

All alchemists learn the basics of their science: the elements, chemical reactions, and alchemical formulae. Beyond that, alchemists pick up a specialty which they practice and research in depth. Some focus on the healing arts, and some focus on destruction, where others focus on research or potion-brewing. Fields of study are as varied as the alchemists which research them and have applications equally as diverse.

| NAME            | DESCRIPTION                                                         |

| Xenoalchemist   | Modifies their body and the bodies of others with monster surgery   |

### Amorist

The study of mind-affecting alchemy is a delicate one, practiced only by a small number of alchemists, known as amorists. Often called “love doctors” by their clientele, amorists specialize in the brewing of potions that produce strong emotional responses in their drinkers. While love potions are by far their most popular product, amorists can also craft pungent pheromone bombs which can even soften the hearts of terrible monsters.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.

FORMULA:PHEROMONE BOMB

Starting at 2nd level, you can craft pheromone bombs. By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a potent pheromone, you can change it into a pheromone bomb. A pheromone bomb requires a Wisdom saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. The bomb deals no damage, and instead causes the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, to be charmed by you until the end of its turn or it takes damage.

MAGNETIC PERSONALITY

Starting at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to Charisma checks that you make.

ALCHEMICAL PERFUME

Beginning at 10th level, you wear an aromatic mind-altering perfume which endears others to you. When a hostile creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against you bomb save DC or have disadvantage on the attack roll. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. Creatures which are immune to being charmed automatically succeed this save.

ALCHEMICAL ROMANCE

Starting at 18th level, during a long rest, you can spend 4 reagent dice to make an extremely potent potion of true love. This potion acts much like a philter of love, except that when you make the potion, you choose the creature the target regards as its true love, provided the target knows the creature or meets it within 24 hours of consuming the potion. Additionally, this effect lasts indefinitely, ended only when you make a new potion of true love, or the effect is removed with a remove curse spell or similar magic. When this potion’s effects are ended on a target, it regards the creature it once loved with total disgust, and can never love that creature again.

### Apothecary

Many practically-minded alchemists assume the role of the apothecary, for adventuring parties always needs a healer, and clerics might be in short supply. During their downtime, such alchemists have a marketable skill to depend upon for income and can do an indisputable amount of good with their knowledge. Apothecaries are constantly at work studying potions and herbology, preferring to learn how to mend the body, rather than destroy it.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill.

FORMULA:PAINKILLER BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create painkiller bombs. By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a slurry of analgesic oil, you can change it into a painkiller bomb. A painkiller bomb deals no damage, and instead grants each creature within its blast radius temporary hit points equal to 1d8 plus half your alchemist level, which last until the end of your next turn. This bomb has no effect on constructs and undead.

POTION TOSS

Starting at 6th level, you’ve developed a chemical mechanism to deliver potions more effectively to distant allies. You can use your action to hurl a potion at a willing or unconscious creature within 20 feet of you. The target gains the benefit as if they had drank the potion normally.

SELF-MEDICATION

By 10th level, you’ve tested out your own tolerances to painkillers such that you can take a small measure regularly without ill effect. Whenever you drink a potion that has the effect of restoring your hit points (even if you already have all of your hit points), you gain advantage on saving throws until the end of your next turn.

ALCHEMICAL RESURRECTION

Starting at 18th level, your medicines are potent enough to rouse the dead. By using your action to mix 500 gp worth of diamond dust into a potion of superior healing or a potion of supreme healing, you create a potion of raise dead. Pouring this concoction on a humanoid corpse that has been dead no longer than 10 days as an action causes the effect of the raise dead spell.

### Dynamo Engineer

As an early alchemical thesis states, if the fundamental energy of magic could be captured within physical substance, there would be no need for magic-users. Some alchemists have founded their careers on this notion, inventing and iterating upon small devices known as spell dynamos, which can store and manipulate arcane energy. These dynamos can be configured to store their energy at a specific resonance, such that, when it is released, it perfectly replicates the effect of a spell. Indeed, these few alchemists have begun to brave the frontier of spellcasting without an ounce of arcane talent; just a knack for tinkering and endless inventiveness.

SPECTRUM ANALYZER

Starting at 2nd level, you have invented a small device shaped like a monocle capable of rendering magical auras visible to the naked eye. You can cast the spell detect magic once without using a spell slot or spell components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

SPELLCASTING

Also at 2nd level, you’ve learned to cast spells by storing and releasing energy in spell dynamos. Spell Dynamos. You power your spells through handheld arcane devices called spell dynamos, which each hold a single spell slot. The Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Preparing Spells.

Unlike other spells, you must prepare spell dynamos in advance. When you finish a long rest, you configure each of your dynamos to cast a particular wizard spell you know. You can only use a spell dynamo to cast a spell to which it is configured. When you finish a short or long rest, you can reconfigure your unexpended spell dynamos to hold different spells.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you cast them using cutting-edge arcane technology. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Use your bomb save DC when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast, and use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with one.

| LVL  | SPELLS | DYNAMOS | SLOT LVL |
| :--: | :----: | :-----: | :------: |
| 2nd  | 3      | 2       | 1st      |

| 20th | 13     | 7       | 4th      |

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

FORMULA:ARCANO BOMB

Starting at 6th level, you can use craft arcano bombs. By adding an unexpended dynamo to the bomb (and thus expending its spell slot), you can change it into an arcano bomb. An arcano bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage, has d12 damage dice, and deals an additional die of damage, as if a reagent die were added to it.

COUNTER-DISCHARGE

Beginning at 10th level, when a creature you can see casts a spell which affects you, you can use your reaction to expend a spell dynamo to release a wave of disruptive magical energy. If the spell requires you to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you have advantage on the saving throw. If the spell deals damage, you have resistance against it. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

ARCANE RECYCLER

By 18th level, you can convert otherwise wasted magical energy into a usable form. When you miss with an arcano bomb, you can recycle the spell slot stored in the dynamo and transfer it to one of a number waiting empty dynamos on your person.

### Mad Bomber

While many “mad bombers” aren’t actually mad, it takes a special kind of crazy to devote one’s life to studying explosives. Most alchemists who specialize in this field are incorrigible pyromaniacs who take great pleasure in burning, blasting, and blowing things up. Mad bombers are always working to improve their bombs’ effectiveness.

BLASTING SPECIALTY

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, your bombs deal double damage to objects and structures.

FORMULA:SHRAPNEL BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create shrapnel bombs. By augmenting your bomb’s explosive contents with metal bearings, you can change it into a shrapnel bomb. A shrapnel bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and explodes in a 10-foot radius.

TIMED DEMOLITION

Starting at 6th level, when you take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb and throw it, you can set a duration for its detonation, which can be any number of rounds (any increment of 6 seconds) up to one minute. Following this duration, the bomb detonates at the end of your turn. No matter how many bombs detonate at once, a creature in more than one blast radius is affected only once.

BLAST SHIELD

Starting at 10th level, you have developed an elemental plating to protect you from hazardous energies. You gain resistance to your choice of acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage and can change your selection whenever you finish a long rest.

FORMULA:BLACK POWDER BOMB

Beginning at 18th level, you can craft the dreaded black powder bombs. By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a charge of black powder, you can change it into a black powder bomb. A black powder bomb has d12 damage dice.

### Mutagenist

The study of alchemy is fundamentally the study of transformation. All alchemists transmute mundane materials into magical substances: potions, elixirs, and bombs, yet some take it one step further. You have discovered the secrets of the mutagen, the very keystone of transmutation, which allows you to transform your very body, gaining supernatural strength or speed, sprouting additional limbs or claws, or thickening your skin into a stony aegis.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill, as well as with shields.

MUTAGEN

Also at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to inject yourself with a powerful transmutative potion known as a mutagen. You gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 minute, or until you use your bonus action to inject yourself with a different mutagen:

Strength.
- Your Strength score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20.
- Additionally, you sprout claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. You can use this natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, you deal damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. The damage of this attack is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate for the natural weapon.

Dexterity.
- Your Dexterity score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. Additionally, your movement speed increases by 5 feet.

Constitution.
- Your Constitution score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. As a result, your current and maximum hit points increase accordingly with your new Constitution score, but when this effect ends, both your current and maximum hit points decrease by the same amount.

SHARED MUTAGEN

At 6th level, you’ve created a mutagen formulation generic enough to safely be injected into others. You can use your action and spend a reagent die to inject a willing creature within 5 feet of you with a mutagen of your choice. A creature can only be under the effect of one mutagen at a time. Once you have injected another creature with a mutagen, you can’t do so again until the original mutagen ends.

ADVANCED MUTATION

Starting at 10th level, whenever you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose one of the following additional mutations:

Hyperelastic.

Your flesh takes on a rubbery quality, allowing you to bend and stretch with ease. Your melee weapon attacks gain the Reach property, if they did not already have them. Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks you make to escape grapple or slip binds.

Mucilaginous.

Your skin secretes a thick, extremely sticky substance which helps you adhere to objects. You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on ability checks made to escape grapple with you. Polybrachia. You grow a pair of additional arms. These arms are fully functional and can be used to hold weapons and shields (allowing you to hold 2 two-handed weapons, or 4 one-handed weapons), perform somatic components of spells, and perform other actions, though the arms themselves don’t grant you any additional actions.

MUTATED BLOOD

By 18th level, your mutagens have permanently altered your biology. Choose Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This ability score increases by 2 and its maximum becomes 22. Once you have chosen an ability score, this selection can’t be altered.

### Ooze Rancher

Unsurprisingly, oozes, jellies, and slimes are a fascinating subject of subject for alchemists who wish to piece together how inanimate chemicals can form together and rise up in a moving, hungry mass. The answer to this question may very well be at the heart of alchemy itself. Alchemists who choose to research slimes in depth are called ooze ranchers, for they breed and keep numerous slimes to experiment upon.

OOZE EMPATHY

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you’ve developed a pheromone mix which engenders all kinds of slime to you. Whenever an ooze tries to attack you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, its attack misses. On a successful save, the ooze is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.

FORMULA:SLIME BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create slime bombs. By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with the remnants of an ooze, you can change it into a slime bomb. A slime bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a viscous, green slime. No creature coated in slime can take the Dash action or the Disengage action. Slime can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water or by taking an action to remove most of it.

BOTTLED OOZES

Starting at 6th level, you’ve learned a clever alchemical trick for condensing oozes into denser states and storing them in stasis for later use. Whenever you brew potions, you can spend 2 reagent dice to create an ooze bottle (see Chapter 5).

LIQUID ANATOMY

By 10th level, your experiments with ooze alchemy has resulted in injecting yourself with a measure of ozoplasm, a fundamental substance which composes oozes and slimes. As a result, you can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing (though your equipment does not similarly compress). Moreover, you take no additional damage from critical hits.

OOZE JUG

Beginning at 18th level, you’ve solved the major problem preventing large oozes from being bottled: you just needed a much larger bottle. You have one ooze jug, which functions like an ooze bottle, but contains a larger ooze. You can only have one ooze jug at a time and it can only contain one ooze at a time. You can fill it with the following oozes when you brew potions:

| Ooze            | Cost            |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Ochre Jelly     | 4 reagent die   |
| Gelatinous Cube | 8 reagent die   |
| Black Pudding   | 10 reagent dice |

### Venomsmith

For every alchemist that has devoted his or her life to healing the sick and infirm, there is another with a darker calling. Commonly called poisoners or venomsmiths, these alchemists are masters in the art of crafting deadly and debilitating poisons. Whether employed by an assassin’s guild or performing assassinations themselves, a venomsmith’s presence is usually accompanied by untimely death.

POISONER

Beginning when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain the Poisoner discovery. Until you reach 3rd level, you have 2 reagent dice which can spend only on crafting poisons using this discovery. You can’t later replace this discovery with a different one when you gain a level in this class. Additionally, when you deal poison damage to a creature, you ignore resistance to poison damage and you treat immunity to poison damage as resistance instead, dealing half damage.

FORMULA:VENOM BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create venom bombs. By mixing a few drops of a fast-acting toxin into your bomb’s explosive components, you can change it into a venom bomb. A venom bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, have disadvantage on the next Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

ALCHEMICAL ASSASSIN

Beginning at 6th level, you are adept at applying poisons without being seen. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks you make to add ingested poisoned to food or drink, to apply poison to a weapon you are holding without being seen, or to place a vial of poison on another person without them noticing.

MITHRIDATISM

By 10th level, by administering yourself small doses of various poisons and toxins, you have developed immunity to their ravages. You have immunity to poison damage and to being poisoned.

TOXIC RECOMPENSE

Starting the 18th level, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to unleash a spray of poisonous vapor. The attacker must make a Constitution saving throw against your bomb save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the creature takes 1d10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Xenoalchemist

A small number of renegade alchemists elect to experiment on themselves, modifying their anatomy or even outright attaching new body parts. These experiments are often considered unethical and dangerous, even by other alchemists, and those that practice them are branded xenoalchemists for their efforts. As xenolchemists progress in their studies, they invariably stumble upon the dangerous practice of alchemical necromancy, which allows them to imbue unlife upon amalgamations of body parts.

XENOBIOLOGY

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you have advantage on all ability checks you make to identify or research monsters.

MAD SCIENTIST

By 2nd level, you’ve learned the finer points of reanimating dead appendages and stitching them to things. You gain two monstrous grafts of your choice. Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft. See Appendix C for monstrous grafts.

SURGICAL ATTACK

Beginning at 6th level, whenever you take the Attack or Use an Object action on your turn, you can make an unarmed strike. You can only use this ability if your unarmed strike is improved by a graft, such as Bestial Features.

NECROMANTIC ORGANS

By 10th level, you’ve learned how to tinge your own biology with necromancy through reanimated organs that will persist after your death. If you drop to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

CHALLENGE

5 (1,800 XP)

Aversion to Fire. Whenever the alchemy golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

Immutable Form. The alchemy golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. Lightning Absorption. Whenever the alchemy golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to half the lightning damage dealt.

Magic Resistance. The alchemy golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Monstrous Grafts. The alchemy golem’s weapon attacks, including monstrous grafts added by its creator, are magical. Monstrous grafts have a +6 attack bonus, deals twice the normal number of damage dice, and add 5 to damage rolls. The alchemical golem can only have 1 graft in each slot.

ACTIONS

Multiattack. The alchemy golem makes two melee weapon attacks. Slam.

Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

IT'S ALIVE!

Beginning at 18th level, your research into the field of necromancy has culminated in an alchemical golem stitched together from discarded body parts. You can create an alchemy golem in an 8-hour long procedure, which can be conducted over the course of a long rest. To complete this process, you must have a healer’s kit, alchemist’s supplies, and a knife (or a facility with access to such tools), as well as at least three recently deceased humanoid corpses.

Your alchemy golem acts independently on its own turn, but always obeys your commands. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command your golem if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the golem will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the golem only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the golem continues to follow it until its task is complete. When the alchemy golem drops to 0 hit points, it dies. You can restore your alchemy golem’s hit points and reanimate it over the course of a short or long rest.

You can attach up to three grafts to your alchemy golem. You can only have one alchemy golem at a time.
