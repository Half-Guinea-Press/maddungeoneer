# EXPLOSIVE MISSILE

As a bonus action, you can load one of your bombs onto the head of a crossbow bolt. Instead of its normal damage, this bolt deals damage as if the bomb had been primed with the Use an Object action, but does not have a blast radius. Only one of your bombs can be loaded onto a bolt at a time, and you canâ€™t fire an explosive bolt on the same turn you throw a bomb.
