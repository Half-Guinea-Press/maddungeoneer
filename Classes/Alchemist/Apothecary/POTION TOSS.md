# POTION TOSS

Starting at 6th level, youâ€™ve developed a chemical mechanism to deliver potions more effectively to distant allies. You can use your action to hurl a potion at a willing or unconscious creature within 20 feet of you. The target gains the benefit as if they had drank the potion normally.
