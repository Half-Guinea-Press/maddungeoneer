# Mutagenist

The study of alchemy is fundamentally the study of transformation. All alchemists transmute mundane materials into magical substances: potions, elixirs, and bombs, yet some take it one step further. You have discovered the secrets of the mutagen, the very keystone of transmutation, which allows you to transform your very body, gaining supernatural strength or speed, sprouting additional limbs or claws, or thickening your skin into a stony aegis.

## BONUS PROFICIENCIES

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill, as well as with shields.

## MUTAGEN

Also at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to inject yourself with a powerful transmutative potion known as a mutagen. You gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 minute, or until you use your bonus action to inject yourself with a different mutagen:

### Strength.
- Your Strength score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20.
- Additionally, you sprout claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. You can use this natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, you deal damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. The damage of this attack is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate for the natural weapon.

### Dexterity.
- Your Dexterity score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. Additionally, your movement speed increases by 5 feet.

### Constitution.
- Your Constitution score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. As a result, your current and maximum hit points increase accordingly with your new Constitution score, but when this effect ends, both your current and maximum hit points decrease by the same amount.

## SHARED MUTAGEN

At 6th level, you’ve created a mutagen formulation generic enough to safely be injected into others. You can use your action and spend a reagent die to inject a willing creature within 5 feet of you with a mutagen of your choice. A creature can only be under the effect of one mutagen at a time. Once you have injected another creature with a mutagen, you can’t do so again until the original mutagen ends.

## ADVANCED MUTATION

Starting at 10th level, whenever you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose one of the following additional mutations:

### Hyperelastic.

Your flesh takes on a rubbery quality, allowing you to bend and stretch with ease. Your melee weapon attacks gain the Reach property, if they did not already have them. Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks you make to escape grapple or slip binds.

### Mucilaginous.

Your skin secretes a thick, extremely sticky substance which helps you adhere to objects. You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on ability checks made to escape grapple with you. Polybrachia. You grow a pair of additional arms. These arms are fully functional and can be used to hold weapons and shields (allowing you to hold 2 two-handed weapons, or 4 one-handed weapons), perform somatic components of spells, and perform other actions, though the arms themselves don’t grant you any additional actions.

## MUTATED BLOOD

By 18th level, your mutagens have permanently altered your biology. Choose Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This ability score increases by 2 and its maximum becomes 22. Once you have chosen an ability score, this selection can’t be altered.
