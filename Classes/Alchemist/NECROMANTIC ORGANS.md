# NECROMANTIC ORGANS

By 10th level, you’ve learned how to tinge your own biology with necromancy through reanimated organs that will persist after your death. If you drop to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
