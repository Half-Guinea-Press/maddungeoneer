# SLIME BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create slime bombs. By mixing your bombâ€™s explosive contents with the remnants of an ooze, you can change it into a slime bomb. A slime bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a viscous, green slime. No creature coated in slime can take the Dash action or the Disengage action. Slime can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water or by taking an action to remove most of it.
