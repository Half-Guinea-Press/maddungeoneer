# OOZE JUG

Beginning at 18th level, youâ€™ve solved the major problem preventing large oozes from being bottled: you just needed a much larger bottle. You have one ooze jug, which functions like an ooze bottle, but contains a larger ooze. You can only have one ooze jug at a time and it can only contain one ooze at a time. You can fill it with the following oozes when you brew potions:

| Ooze            | Cost            |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Ochre Jelly     | 4 reagent die   |
| Gelatinous Cube | 8 reagent die   |
| Black Pudding   | 10 reagent dice |
