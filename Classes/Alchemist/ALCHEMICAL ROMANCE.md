# ALCHEMICAL ROMANCE

Starting at 18th level, during a long rest, you can spend 4 reagent dice to make an extremely potent potion of true love. This potion acts much like a philter of love, except that when you make the potion, you choose the creature the target regards as its true love, provided the target knows the creature or meets it within 24 hours of consuming the potion. Additionally, this effect lasts indefinitely, ended only when you make a new potion of true love, or the effect is removed with a remove curse spell or similar magic. When this potionâ€™s effects are ended on a target, it regards the creature it once loved with total disgust, and can never love that creature again.
