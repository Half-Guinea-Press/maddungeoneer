# BEGUILING HAZE

Prerequisites: 13th level, Amorist Field of Study

When you charm a creature, you can choose to place it in a dreamy state, from which it regards everyone it sees as close friends. While the creature is charmed, it is nonhostile and acts as though it is charmed equally by each creature it sees. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
