You have learned many things about alchemy during your studies. Starting at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any ability check you make to identify herbs, potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances. This bonus stacks with your normal proficiency bonus, if you would add that already.
