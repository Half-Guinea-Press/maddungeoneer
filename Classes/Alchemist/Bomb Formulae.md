# Bomb Formulae

By 2nd level, your research has granted you insight into new alchemical formulations for your bombs. Select three bomb formulae from the Bomb Formulae section below. Once per turn, when you take the Use an Object action to throw a bomb, you can apply a formula to it.

When you gain certain levels in this class, you learn additional formulae of your choice, as shown in the Bomb Formulae Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the formulae you know and replace it with another formula.

Bomb formulae are summarized on the following table. If a bomb is exclusively available to one field of study, it will be marked with an asterisk. Unless otherwise stated, all bombs produce a loud boom, audible out to one mile. Bombs are presented in alphabetical order.
