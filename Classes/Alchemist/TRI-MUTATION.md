# TRI-MUTATION

Prerequisites: 13th level, Mutagenist Field of Study

You’ve developed a powerful, but fleeting way of blending your mutagens together. When you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose to inject a tri-mutagen, which grants you the benefit of all your mutagens at once. This benefit lasts for 1 minute, or until you use your bonus action to inject yourself with a different mutagen. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
