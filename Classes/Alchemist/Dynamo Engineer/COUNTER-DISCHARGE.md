# COUNTER-DISCHARGE

Beginning at 10th level, when a creature you can see casts a spell which affects you, you can use your reaction to expend a spell dynamo to release a wave of disruptive magical energy. If the spell requires you to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you have advantage on the saving throw. If the spell deals damage, you have resistance against it. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.
