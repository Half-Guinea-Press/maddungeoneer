# SPECTRUM ANALYZER

Starting at 2nd level, you have invented a small device shaped like a monocle capable of rendering magical auras visible to the naked eye. You can cast the spell detect magic once without using a spell slot or spell components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.
