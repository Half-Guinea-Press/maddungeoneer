# Field of Study

While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level.

A formula granted by your field of study does not count against the total number of formulae you know.

All alchemists learn the basics of their science: the elements, chemical reactions, and alchemical formulae. Beyond that, alchemists pick up a specialty which they practice and research in depth. Some focus on the healing arts, and some focus on destruction, where others focus on research or potion-brewing. Fields of study are as varied as the alchemists which research them and have applications equally as diverse.
