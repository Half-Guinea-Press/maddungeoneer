# Amorist

The study of mind-affecting alchemy is a delicate one, practiced only by a small number of alchemists, known as amorists. Often called “love doctors” by their clientele, amorists specialize in the brewing of potions that produce strong emotional responses in their drinkers. While love potions are by far their most popular product, amorists can also craft pungent pheromone bombs which can even soften the hearts of terrible monsters.

## BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.

## FORMULA:PHEROMONE BOMB

Starting at 2nd level, you can craft pheromone bombs. By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a potent pheromone, you can change it into a pheromone bomb. A pheromone bomb requires a Wisdom saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. The bomb deals no damage, and instead causes the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, to be charmed by you until the end of its turn or it takes damage.

## MAGNETIC PERSONALITY

Starting at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to Charisma checks that you make.

## ALCHEMICAL PERFUME

Beginning at 10th level, you wear an aromatic mind-altering perfume which endears others to you. When a hostile creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against you bomb save DC or have disadvantage on the attack roll. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. Creatures which are immune to being charmed automatically succeed this save.

## ALCHEMICAL ROMANCE

Starting at 18th level, during a long rest, you can spend 4 reagent dice to make an extremely potent potion of true love. This potion acts much like a philter of love, except that when you make the potion, you choose the creature the target regards as its true love, provided the target knows the creature or meets it within 24 hours of consuming the potion. Additionally, this effect lasts indefinitely, ended only when you make a new potion of true love, or the effect is removed with a remove curse spell or similar magic. When this potion’s effects are ended on a target, it regards the creature it once loved with total disgust, and can never love that creature again.
