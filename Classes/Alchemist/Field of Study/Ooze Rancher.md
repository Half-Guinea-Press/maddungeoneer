# Ooze Rancher

Unsurprisingly, oozes, jellies, and slimes are a fascinating subject of subject for alchemists who wish to piece together how inanimate chemicals can form together and rise up in a moving, hungry mass. The answer to this question may very well be at the heart of alchemy itself. Alchemists who choose to research slimes in depth are called ooze ranchers, for they breed and keep numerous slimes to experiment upon.

## OOZE EMPATHY

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you’ve developed a pheromone mix which engenders all kinds of slime to you. Whenever an ooze tries to attack you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, its attack misses. On a successful save, the ooze is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.

## FORMULA:SLIME BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create slime bombs. By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with the remnants of an ooze, you can change it into a slime bomb. A slime bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a viscous, green slime. No creature coated in slime can take the Dash action or the Disengage action. Slime can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water or by taking an action to remove most of it.

## BOTTLED OOZES

Starting at 6th level, you’ve learned a clever alchemical trick for condensing oozes into denser states and storing them in stasis for later use. Whenever you brew potions, you can spend 2 reagent dice to create an ooze bottle (see Chapter 5).

## LIQUID ANATOMY

By 10th level, your experiments with ooze alchemy has resulted in injecting yourself with a measure of ozoplasm, a fundamental substance which composes oozes and slimes. As a result, you can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing (though your equipment does not similarly compress). Moreover, you take no additional damage from critical hits.

## OOZE JUG

Beginning at 18th level, you’ve solved the major problem preventing large oozes from being bottled: you just needed a much larger bottle. You have one ooze jug, which functions like an ooze bottle, but contains a larger ooze. You can only have one ooze jug at a time and it can only contain one ooze at a time. You can fill it with the following oozes when you brew potions:

| Ooze            | Cost            |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Ochre Jelly     | 4 reagent die   |
| Gelatinous Cube | 8 reagent die   |
| Black Pudding   | 10 reagent dice |
