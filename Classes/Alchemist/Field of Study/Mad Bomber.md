# Mad Bomber

While many “mad bombers” aren’t actually mad, it takes a special kind of crazy to devote one’s life to studying explosives. Most alchemists who specialize in this field are incorrigible pyromaniacs who take great pleasure in burning, blasting, and blowing things up. Mad bombers are always working to improve their bombs’ effectiveness.

## BLASTING SPECIALTY

Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, your bombs deal double damage to objects and structures.

## FORMULA:SHRAPNEL BOMB

At 2nd level, you can create shrapnel bombs. By augmenting your bomb’s explosive contents with metal bearings, you can change it into a shrapnel bomb. A shrapnel bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and explodes in a 10-foot radius.

## TIMED DEMOLITION

Starting at 6th level, when you take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb and throw it, you can set a duration for its detonation, which can be any number of rounds (any increment of 6 seconds) up to one minute. Following this duration, the bomb detonates at the end of your turn. No matter how many bombs detonate at once, a creature in more than one blast radius is affected only once.

## BLAST SHIELD

Starting at 10th level, you have developed an elemental plating to protect you from hazardous energies. You gain resistance to your choice of acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage and can change your selection whenever you finish a long rest.

## FORMULA:BLACK POWDER BOMB

Beginning at 18th level, you can craft the dreaded black powder bombs. By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a charge of black powder, you can change it into a black powder bomb. A black powder bomb has d12 damage dice.
