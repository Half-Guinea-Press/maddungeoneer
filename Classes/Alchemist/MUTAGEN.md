# MUTAGEN

Also at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to inject yourself with a powerful transmutative potion known as a mutagen. You gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 minute, or until you use your bonus action to inject yourself with a different mutagen:

## Strength.
- Your Strength score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20.
- Additionally, you sprout claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. You can use this natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, you deal damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. The damage of this attack is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate for the natural weapon.

## Dexterity.
- Your Dexterity score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. Additionally, your movement speed increases by 5 feet.

## Constitution.
- Your Constitution score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. As a result, your current and maximum hit points increase accordingly with your new Constitution score, but when this effect ends, both your current and maximum hit points decrease by the same amount.
