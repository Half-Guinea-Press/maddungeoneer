# Discoveries

In the course of your research, you have made a number of discoveries regarding the nature of alchemy. At 4th level, you gain two discoveries of your choice. When you gain certain alchemist levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Known column of the Alchemist table.

Additionally, when you learn a new discovery, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.

If a discovery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the discovery at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. You can only learn a discovery once, unless otherwise specified.
