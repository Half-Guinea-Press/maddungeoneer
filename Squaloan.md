# Squaloan

“Aye, I can take you 'cross the water, but its gonna cost ya'.”stated the older dwarf, his thick grayed beard drenched inwhatever foul smelling ale he was drinking. “See those aresqual waters. Normally fine folk, if you follow their rules. Butstep out a'line, or - gods forbid! - bring a merfolk, and you'reshark meat friend.” “Don’t give them a bad name. They’vesaved many ships” protested the younger elven man sittingnext to him. “And sunk just as many! Now, do ya' want myship or not?”

Tall, frightening, and tailless shark-like creatures with awicked smile, squaloans often terrify would be sailors fromever crossing the seas. From lone hunters, to groups sized inthe small hundreds, squaloan call the seas home. Very littleties an individual squaloan to another, but most form familiesin parts of the ocean rich with life, like coral reefs. Whileseparate, and often very different in culture, two things bindsthem together: An extreme distrust of merfolk and fey, and aninnate brutish nature that often leads to conflict.

## Mercenaries of the Sea

Squaloans tread on the borders between civility and tribalismat all times. Each clan finds its own way of life, but most tendto lead to a similar path. Due to their immense strength andknowledge of the seas, it's extremely common for sailors tohire local clans of squaloan to guide ships. As long as thesailors pay what they are due, there's rarely issue, but due toa few greedy sailors many have heard of the ferocity of ahostile squoloan.

This coupled with the more territorial and hostile tribesgives squaloan a bad reputation among many, and has lead toseveral cities hunting them to near extinction.

## Friends for Life

Squaloans dont often make friends outside their tribe, oftenfinding bond in what is called in their tribe a “SquailBrother”. This is a permanent bond between two squaloan ashunting family, and while similar to marriage of other races,this does not necessarily entail a romantic relationship.Squail brothers have an understanding they would die toprotect one another, and take this agreement only if one istruly worthy, considering it the highest form of respect. It isunusual but not unheard of for races outside squaloan tobecome one's Squail brother, but is never mocked or lookeddown on. To a squaloan, if one is worthy of being called asquail brother, then they are worthy of respect.

## Squaloan Names

Squaloan are not given names at birth, instead they usuallydecide what it is when they finish their first hunt, but thischanges tribe to tribe. The only thing that doesn't change isthe first hunt: it's always a fey, a sahuagin, or merrow. Thechosen name often focuses on a specific element of that hunt,like a wound inflicted or received, a feeling, or an element ofthe environment. Squaloan have recently begun to take onhuman names as more and more interact with other species.

Tribe Names take on the location they inhabit.

Common Classic Squaloan Names: Lost Blood, BlueScales, Festered Wound, Murky, Night

Tribe Names: Of Lost Seas, Beneath Coral Shelves,Beside rocky shores, Of the depths unseen

## What other races think of them

Humans: Friend or foe, no one can denysqualoans birth right. Their tribes know the seasbetter than most, and any ship friends with one islucky indeed, and woe to those that are enemies tothem.

Dwarves: What's a Squaloan? Heard the name,but can't remember where from. Some oceancreature I think, but about all gone. Makin' toomany enemies, foolish of 'em.

Elves: Brutish creatures, they demand payment interritory ruled by others and attack like commonbandits. Nothing good comes from them.

Dragonborn: Honorable, can't deny that. Theyalways impress how capable they are, even beinghunted they live and maintain their lifestyle well.
